### Example Workflow

Dors is a first year graduate student assigned to get an overview of which brain regions are typically recruited
during finger tapping.
Dors recently heard about compose.neurosynth.org and decided to check the website out to see if it would be helpful
for her work.
Dors goes to the landing page and clicks on the right corner button to sign up and uses her google account.
From there she clicks on the studies tab to search for "finger tapping".

A few studies show up from the search and she begins to read a few of the associated articles.
If the study does indeed use a finger tapping task, she wants to keep track of those studies.
To the left of the study there is a plus button.
She clicks on the plus button and sees she can add the study to a "study-set".
She names the studyset "finger tapping" and adds the selected study.
When she is done reading and adding all relevent studies, she notices
that the finger tapping task typically falls under three categories:
1) right handed index finger,
2) right handed multiple fingers, and
3) both hands.

Using this information, she views her studyset and adds an annotation with three columns,
one for each type of finger tapping task: RH_index_finger, RH_multi_finger, and bimanual.
For each analysis in each study, Dors reads the tables reporting the brain coordinates
and marks the analysis as one of the three categories.
