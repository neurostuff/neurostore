## Studyset

### Overview

A studyset is a collection of studies and serves as the primary input
to a meta-analysis.

### Functions

If an existing studyset is close to what you want or provides a good starting
point, you may clone the studyset.
From there you can add additional studies or remove studies from the studyset.
If you would like to change which analyses are included for analysis in the studyset,
we recommend you use annotations instead.

## Annotation

### Overview

Annotations serve three functions:
1. human-readable documentation (for example, following PRISMA)
2. Specifying co-variates to be used in the meta-analysis
3. Filtering Analyses for inclusion in the meta-analysis

Annotations can be thought of like an excel sheet, where
the columns are variables serving one of the three functions above
and each analysis has value for that variable.
For example, an "include" column may have a value of "True" or "False"
for each analysis indicating whether to include the analysis in the
meta-analysis.

### Functions

Annotations can also be cloned if you disagree with an existing annotation
you do not own and want to edit it.

## Study

### Overview

A study is a publishable unit of research containing neuroimaging
data. 
The data can be represented as peak coordinates or the actual images.
The study is connected to the original journal it was published in.

### Functions

Studies can be created, cloned, and edited to accomodate your needs for your meta-analysis

## Analysis

### Overview

An analysis represents a single statistical contrast between any number of groups/conditions.
The contents of an analysis include the terms applied to the groups/conditions and their respective
weights in the contrast.
An analysis also contains the results of the statistical contrast either with an image and/or a table
indicating significant results 

## Condition

### Overview

A condition is term/word that represents a psychological (e.g., 2-back), physical (e.g., biking)
