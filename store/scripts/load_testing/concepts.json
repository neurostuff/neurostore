Examples (from Ward et al.(cited below)) include memory retrieval, association formation among information retrieved from memory, combinations of structures retrieved from memory, the synthesis of new structures, the transformation of retrieved structures into &#34;new forms,&#34; analogical transfer between domains, and &#34;categorical reduction,&#34; which involves reducing existing structures to &#34;more primitive constituents&#34;.  \r\n\r\nExploratory processes are the processes used to explore the structures produced by generative processes. Examples of exploratory processes (given by Ward, et al.) include searching retrieved structures for &#34;novel attributes,&#34; searching for &#34;metaphorical implications,&#34; searching for possible functions, &#34;the evaluation of structures from different perspectives or within different contexts,&#34; interpretation of structures from the perspective of the problem(s) to be solved, and &#34;the search for various practical or conceptual limitations that are suggested by the structures.&#34;\r\n","id_user":"usr_0000000000","id":"trm_4a3fd79d09f2a"},{"id_concept_class":"ctp_C3","creation_time":1512660629031,"event_stamp":"2009-06-22T19:12:55","def_id_user":"usr_49a467bf4e0db","def_event_stamp":"2012-03-28T16:45:09","last_updated":1512660629031,"def_id":"def_4f73401536133","name":"creative problem solving","alias":"","definition_text":"the mental process of independently creating a solution to a problem without learned assistance.","id_user":"usr_0000000000","id":"trm_4a3fd79d09f36"},{"id_concept_class":"","creation_time":1512660629052,"event_stamp":"2009-06-22T19:12:55","def_id_user":"usr_4b9003ea0be96","def_event_stamp":"2011-04-19T19:17:09","last_updated":1512660629052,"def_id":"def_4daddfb58e952","name":"creative thinking","alias":"","definition_text":"the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action (Scriven & Paul, 1992).","id_user":"usr_0000000000","id":"trm_4a3fd79d09f42"},{"id_concept_class":"","creation_time":1512660629083,"event_stamp":"2009-06-22T19:12:55","def_id_user":"usr_4b9003ea0be96","def_event_stamp":"2011-05-16T18:59:08","last_updated":1512660629083,"def_id":"def_4dd173fc30404","name":"critical period","alias":"","definition_text":"a limited time in which an event can occur, usually to result in some kind of transformation;

A typical example is a gamble offering $400 or $600 based on the outcome of a coin flip (i.e. with equal probability (50%)); this is less risky as compared to a similar gamble offering $200 or $800 [again depending on the outcome of a coin flip]. Notice here that the mean outcome (or âexpected valueâ) remains the same for both gambles.\r\n\r\nThus risk can increase by keeping both the probabilities and the expected value the same. \r\n\r\nThere are other approaches to risk that are less mathematically stringent but have higher ecological validity. For instance increasing the probability of a (positive outcome) is associated with a reduced perception of risk. Notice though now that the expected value (or the mean outcome) also increases. So, it is difficult in that case to disentangle the two metrics.\r\n\r\nMany times  the term risk is associated with the probability of a negative outcome, or what is formally called downside risk. This idea is mostly due to the way actuarial science and insurance companies (which are more interested in the negative aspects of risk) use the term. For instance, the statement, ânow we increase the risk,â might be translated as taking more perilous actions, but formally, this is not the case. The point of risk is that the opportunity also increases (âupsideâ risk). Thus, a situation that is riskier can be attractive, especially if the agent focuses on the positive outcomes.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is the so-called âmoment-basedâ approach. Here, one is interested in the second or higher moments of a distribution, roughly corresponding to variance, skewness and kurtosis. Skewness is of particular interest because it seems that risk-seeking persons (gamblers) can be attracted by positively skewed outcomes. Bets that offer a small probability of a high outcome are  attractive to gamblers (Garrett and Sobel, 1999).\r\n\r\nOverall, risk is not a unitary concept and should be very carefully defined.\r\n\r\nNote that the term risk as used here should be distinguished from the way the term is used in sentences such as &#34;risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s disease&#34;. An epidemiologist could help on the definition in that context.\r\n\r\nInput by other contributors:\r\nthe probability or likelihood that an event will occur; possibility of loss or injury; someone or something that creates or suggests a hazard; the chance that an investment will lose value.","id_user":"usr_0000000000","id":"trm_4a3fd79d0afcf"},{"id_concept_class":"","creation_time":1512660634742,"event_stamp":"2009-06-22T19:12:56","def_id_user":"usr_4e429d2c8a0e5","def_event_stamp":"2011-08-12T19:17:07","last_updated":1512660634742,"def_id":"def_4e457c33ca198","name":"route knowledge","alias":"","definition_text":"is represented as a series of directions to follow to get from one place to another.","id_user":"usr_0000000000","id":"trm_4a3fd79d0afda"},{"id_concept_class":"","creation_time":1512660634763,"event_stamp":"2009-06-22T19:12:56","def_id_user":"usr_4b9003ea0be96","def_event_stamp":"2011-05-10T21:42:43","last_updated":1512660634763,"def_id":"def_4dc9b153a0446","name":"routine","alias":"","definition_text":"a regular course of procedure;

The direct pathway is assumed to \"gate\" / release actions, while the indirect pathway is believed to suppress/inhibit actions. The direct pathway features more dopamine D1 receptors (activated by high dopamine levels as in positive prediction errors elicited by rewards), while the indirect pathway features more dopamine D2/D3 receptors (activated by low dopamine levels as in negative prediction errors elicited by punishments). Hence, rewards should make the direct pathway more sensitive to input and thus facilitate action release, while punishments should make the indirect pathway more  sensitive to input and thus facilitate action suppression.\r\n\r\nPavlovian biases are typically measured with the motivational go/nogo learning task.\r\nfMRI studies featuring this task having typically not found BOLD signal from the striatum/ basal ganglia to reflect reward vs. punishment anticipation (as predicted by the above basal ganglia model), but instead to reflect the executed response (Go vs. NoGo) (Guitart-Masip et al., 2011; Guitart-Masip, Huys et al., 2012; Guitart-Masip, Chowdhury et al., 2012; Moutoussis et al., 2018; Algermissen et al., 2021). Instead, cue valence (Win vs. Avoid) has been found to be encoded in vmPFC BOLD (positively) and ACC BOLD (negatively).\r\n\r\nPavlovian bias in behavior could arise from a response bias (i.e. reward/ punishment prospects biasing response selection), but also from biased action-outcome learning: A learning bias such that learning of Go responses after reward feedback is enhanced, while unlearning of NoGo responses after punishment feedback is attenuated, will also give rise to motivational biases (Swart et al., 2017, 2018; de Boer et al., 2019).\r\nPavlovian bias has been suggested as a response strategy in face of little control over the environment (Csifcsák et al., 2019; Dorfman & Gershman, 2019; Gershman et al., 2021).","id":"trm_MaWfLaH0xKHTK"},{"creation_time":1637632426,"last_updated":1637632426,"name":"timing","definition_text":"knowledge of temporal order","id":"trm_vqA8b1BrA6U4V"},{"creation_time":1637694125,"last_updated":1637694125,"name":"pitch discrimination","definition_text":"the ability to respond to pitch differences in the sound","id":"trm_p77NrG4CTxmPS"},{"creation_time":1662318631,"last_updated":1662318631,"name":"delay discounting","definition_text":"Delay discounting is the decline in the present value of a reward with delay to its receipt","id":"trm_a4WdpQW5JYPH0"}]
