9001100.0,BMRMI Reduces Depressive Rumination Possibly through Improving Abnormal FC of Dorsal ACC,," 
Rumination is a common symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been characterized as a vulnerability factor for the onset or recurrence of MDD. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying rumination and appropriate treatment strategies remain unclear. In the current study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of body-mind relaxation meditation induction (BMRMI) intervention in MDD with rumination. To this aim, we have recruited 25 MDD and 24 healthy controls (HCs). Changes in functional connectivity (FC) of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) subregion and the scores of clinical measurements were examined using correlation analysis. At baseline, MDD showed stronger FC between the right dorsal ACC (dACC) and right superior frontal gyrus than did the HC group. Compared to baseline, the HC group showed a significantly enhanced FC between the right dACC and right superior frontal gyrus, and the MDD group demonstrated a significantly weaker FC between the left dACC and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) after the intervention. Furthermore, the FC between the right dACC and right superior frontal gyrus was positively associated with rumination scores across all participants at baseline. The above results indicate that BMRMI may regulate self-referential processing and cognitive function through modulating FC of the dACC in MDD with rumination.

## 1. Introduction 
  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disease, which is characterized by anhedonia, repetitive rumination, and cognitive impairment [ ]. The lifetime prevalence rate of MDD is about 11–15%, and it affects approximately 5–6% of people worldwide each year [ – ]. One risk factor for MDD onset or recurrence is depressive rumination, which is conceptualized as passive and repetitive attention to one's negative aspects and a tendency to focus on their possible causes and negative consequences [ ,  ]. Moreover, there is evidence that higher levels of rumination are correlated with other clinical outcomes, such as a slower treatment response [ ,  ] and inferior initial remission [ ,  ]. Recent studies have reported that body-mind relaxation meditation induction (BMRMI) can significantly reduce depressive rumination [ ]. However, the mechanisms underlying it is still not clear. 

BMRMI, a kind of mindfulness meditation, has been found to reduce anxious and depressive symptoms, without any side effects [ ]. BMRMI resembles yoga; in that, it promotes the ability to change physiological behavior during a guided relaxation process and also facilitates positive emotional experiences [ ]. More importantly, BMRMI involves listening to musical melody and relaxation instructions, which enable individuals to balance their physical and mental state and promote the recovery of cognitive function and negative emotions [ ]. Clinical reports have indicated that mindfulness meditation is beneficial for developing alternative responses to negative thoughts and reducing habitual rumination [ ]. Neuroimaging studies have shown that BMRMI can affect brain regions which were related with attention and emotional processing, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), frontal cortex, insula, and sensorimotor cortex [ ]. 

In recent years, neuroimaging studies have found that increased rumination was related to altered activation and connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) in MDD [ – ]. The DMN comprises the precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and is implicated in self-referential processing, emotion regulating, and cognitive improving [ – ]. Cooney et al. (2010) found that there is significantly more activation in mPFC and PCC in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls (HCs) during rumination induction [ ]. Recent studies have also indicated that depressive rumination is correlated with activity in a range of regions (e.g., the ACC, amygdala, and hippocampus), which are known to be implicated in attention control and autobiographical memory [ ,  ]. Kühn et al. (2012) demonstrated that ruminative thoughts were negatively associated with gray matter density and activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and ACC [ ]. Using independent component analysis, rumination scores were found to be associated with increased functional connectivity (FC) between the ventral mPFC and ventral ACC [ ]. Moreover, ACC metabolic activity and connectivity can predict the response to antidepressants and other therapies [ – ]. The ACC therefore seems to play a particularly major role in rumination, treatment response, and the remission of MDD. 

Based on its functional heterogeneity and cytoarchitecture, Margulies et al. (2007) divided the ACC into 16 seed regions that are distributed in two parallel rows [ ]. Kelly et al. (2009) proposed that the ACC can be subdivided into five seeds in each hemisphere, each of which is associated with five respective functions [ ]. The subregions of the ACC include the caudal ACC (cACC), dorsal ACC (dACC), rostral ACC, perigenual ACC (pgACC), and subgenual ACC [ ]. The cACC is commonly thought to function in tandem with fronto-parietal regions and has been proposed to integrate sensorimotor processes [ ]. The dACC activation has been associated with autobiographical memory and cognitive control and is proposed to act “circuit hub” in top-down pathway [ ,  ]. The rACC exhibits patterns of activity that are correlated with the amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial PFC, and posterior cingulate cortex, which have been implicated in affective processing [ ,  ]. The pgACC has been demonstrated to consist a component of emotion regulation network and implicated in modulating the increased inner attention to ruminative thinking of patients with MDD [ ,  ]. The sgACC is involved in autonomic control and self-referential processing via connection with the anterior part of DMN [ ]. In this study, we used these ACC subregions as the seed regions for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanism underlying the effect of a short-term BMRMI intervention in MDD with rumination. We hypothesized that BMRMI treatment would strengthen FC in the ACC subregions in MDD with rumination. We also expected that FC changes would be correlated with the clinical variables. 


## 2. Methods 
  
### 2.1. Participants 
  
Participants were 25 patients with MDD who had been diagnosed by administration of the DSM-IV by two qualified psychiatrists [ ], and 24 HCs were also recruited by advertisement from the local community. Education levels and years of education were determined using self-reported information from participants [ ]. All recruited patients with MDD met the following criteria: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score ≥ 17; no stable drug treatment; no other psychiatric symptoms or acute physical disease; and no history of other interventions, especially for mindfulness meditation, qigong practice, or yoga. The exclusion criteria for HCs are as follows: a history of mindfulness meditation in the last 2 months, head injury, no history of alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy, and a family history of psychiatric illnesses. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guang'an Men Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (Beijing, China; ethical approval number 2017-056-KY-01), and informed consent was signed from all participants before study enrollment. 


### 2.2. Measures 
  
The severity of depressive and anxious symptoms was assessed in all participants by two psychiatrists using the HAMD and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). The level of rumination was assessed in all participants using the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) and Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) clinical measurements. The ATQ is a commonly used to evaluate the frequency of automatic occurrence of negative self-thoughts [ ]. The RRS evaluates repetitive responses to depressed emotions and passive self-thoughts that focused on a person's negative feelings, relative symptoms, or their causes and consequences [ ]. These measures were not implemented after the BMRMI intervention. 


### 2.3. Intervention 
  
BMRMI is composed of harmonious background music and relaxation-inducing passages. The background music is called “Saishangqu,” which is soft, slow Chinese classical music played by zither [ ]. The relaxation guide passage was conducted in Mandarin by a female speaker, comprising two parts: (1) phrases that induce whole-body relaxation, such as “relax your muscles from top to bottom,” and (2) phrases that induce mind relaxation, such as “feel your body relax and take some downtime.” The BMRMI treatment session lasted 15 minutes. All participants were scanned at both baseline and immediately after the BMRMI intervention. 


### 2.4. rs-fMRI Data Acquisition 
  
All participants underwent brain scans on a 1.5 T GE Signal scanner (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in Guang'an Men Hospital. The functional images were acquired in 41 axial slices from the echo planar imaging sequence (slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 0.5 mm, repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, matrix size = 64 × 64 × 20, flip angle = 90°, and field of view = 24 × 24 cm). All participants underwent a 360-second resting-state scan, and data were acquired 144 time points. All participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed in quiet state while scanning, and foam pads were used to immobilize the head. After scanning, each subject was recorded whether they had not fallen asleep or had been distracted by something during the scan. 


### 2.5. Image Data Preprocessing 
  
The image data were preprocessed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI Advanced Edition (DARSF 4.0) based on MATLAB 2014a software. The first 10 volumes from both scanning sessions were removed. The remaining volumes for each subject were processed to correct head motion and calculate slice timing, normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, and smoothed using a 6 × 6 × 6 full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Data were bandpass-filtered at 0.01–0.08 Hz and linearly detrended. The nuisance signals from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and six parameters of head motion were also regressed out. Any participants who had a translation larger than 2 mm and greater than 2° in any angular dimension were discarded from subsequent analysis [ ,  ]. Two subjects in the MDD group were discarded due to excessive head motion > 2.0 mm during the MRI scanning. The mean framewise displacement was not significantly different between baseline (0.124 ± 0.085) and after BMRMI treatment (0.133 ± 0.014) in the MDD group (  T   = −0.488,   p   = 0.63). 


### 2.6. Seed Region of Interest Functional Analysis 
  
The ACC was divided into five subregions for each hemisphere ( ). The ACC subregions included the cACC (MNI = ±5, −10, 37), dACC (MNI = ±5, 10, 33), rostral ACC (MNI = ±5, 27, 21), pgACC (MNI = ±5, 47, 11), and sgACC (MNI = ±5, 34, −4) [ ,  ]. These seeds were selected as spheres with a 6 mm diameter in the peak center of brain regions, symmetrically in both hemispheres [ ]. For the ACC subregions in both hemispheres, the average time series of each region of interest were extracted. The   p  -correlation coefficients were computed between each ROI mean time coursed and that of each voxel of the whole brain. Fisher's   r  -to-  z   transformation was used to convert FC results to   z  -values to improve the normality. 


### 2.7. Statistical Analyses 
  
All statistical analyses of the demographic data and clinical measurements were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Baseline differences in demographic data and clinical measurements between the MDD group and HCs group were analyzed using a two-sample   t  -test, and sex differences were analyzed using the   χ   test. After verifying the normality and homogeneity of the variance of MRI data, a repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to examine the FC of ACC subregion differences between two groups in both before and after treatment, with age, education, and sex as covariates [ ]. After using Gaussian random field theory to correct the results of statistically significant FC mapping, the voxel-level threshold was   p   < 0.001, and the joint cluster-level threshold was   p   < 0.05. Next, the correlation between the mean change values of FC in ACC subregions and scores of clinical scales was assessed in both groups and in all participants before BMRMI. 



## 3. Results 
  
### 3.1. Demographic Data and Clinical Measurements 
  
The are no significant differences in age (  t   = 0.10,   p   = 0.91), education (  t   = −1.22,   p   = 0.23), or sex (  χ   = 0.07,   p   = 0.792) between two group. Significant between-group differences were found in the HAMD, HAMA, ATQ, and RRS scores (for details, see  ). 


### 3.2. ANOVA Differences in ACC Subregion Seed-Based FC 
  
The region of interest analysis results revealed aberrant FC between MDD group and HC group at baseline and after intervention in the right dACC and right SFG and left dACC and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) ( ). There was a significant difference in FC between the right dACC and right SFG in the MDD group relative to the HC group before BMRMI. After BMRMI treatment, we found a stronger FC between the right dACC and right SFG in both groups relative to baseline. We also found that FC between the dACC and MFG decreased significantly after the intervention within the MDD group; conversely, the FC increased significantly after the intervention within the HC group ( ). 


### 3.3. Correlation Analysis 
  
The correlation between the subregions of ACC FC and clinical measurements in all participants at baseline are shown in  . Correlation analysis revealed that the increased FC between the right dACC and right SFG was significantly correlated with the higher scores of RRS (  r   = 0.50,   p   < 0.01), ATQ (  r   = 0.54,   p   < 0.001), and HAMD (  r   = 0.62,   p   < 0.001) in all participants before BMRMI. 



## 4. Discussion 
  
The present study used rs-fMRI to investigate the effect of BMRMI intervention on FC changes in ACC subregions in patients with MDD. At baseline, the MDD group showed stronger FC between the right dACC and right SFG than did the HC group. After BMRMI treatment, we found an enhanced FC between the right dACC and right SFG in both groups compared to baseline, but this difference was not significant within the MDD group. However, we also found a different connectivity pattern between the left dACC and right MFG in both the MDD group and HC group after BMRMI treatment. In particular, the strength of FC between the right dACC and right SFG was positively correlated with HAMD, RRS, and ATQ scores across all participants before BMRMI. These findings support the notion that BMRMI increases FC between the dACC and SFG through modulating attentional control, and these changes may play a considerable role in MDD with rumination. 

In comparison with HC group, MDD patients showed a stronger FC between the right dACC and right SFG at baseline. Moreover, the increased FC between the right dACC and right SFG was associated with higher rumination scores across all participants at baseline. Previous studies have suggested the differential activity or abnormal FC of ACC subregion activity in MDD is substantively different to that of healthy individuals [ ]. Numerous research has demonstrated that the ACC has high functional coupling with core part of DMN in MDD with rumination [ – ]. For example, the decreased FC between the sgACC and right MFG has been found to be associated with higher RRS scores [ ,  ]. Negative self-focused thought has also been reported to be positively correlated with pgACC connectivity with the dorsolateral PFC [ ]. Another study detected that FC between the dACC and precuneus was positively correlated with rumination in patients with MDD [ ]. Connectivity changes between the dACC and dorsal mPFC have also been observed in the remission of patients with MDD who are prone to rumination [ ]. Importantly, the dACC is not only a hub in a network of regions involving cognitive functioning but forms a part of the salience network, which has been demanded in the processes of attentional control and monitoring conflict [ – ]. Specifically, the correlation between the increased FC of the dACC and SFG with RRS scores found in the present study indicates that depressive rumination is associated with attentional control impairments. Combined with the above results, our findings expand our understanding of abnormal FC between ACC subregions and highlight the role of the DMN as a neural mechanism underlying rumination. 

After BMRMI treatment, FC between the right dACC and right SFG increased significantly in the HC group compared to baseline; however, no such significant increase in FC was found in the MDD group. Given that our intervention was a single brief session of BMRMI and clinical measurement scales were used to evaluate outcomes, we missed the correlation between the difference FC and the change of clinical measurements after treatment, so we need to interpret the results with caution. Our findings may indicate that patients with MDD require greater effort or more adequate treatment to improve higher cognitive processes and avoid negative emotion. Indeed, previous studies have also demonstrated that mindfulness-based intervention has a beneficial effect on cognitive function. For instance, 1 month of music intervention has been found to strengthen FC between the right middle temporal gyrus [ ] and between the dorsal anterior insula and ACC [ ] in patients with schizophrenia. After an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention in healthy individuals, Hölzel et al. (2010) found an increased density of gray matter in the PCC and temporo-parietal junction [ ]. After an 11-hour body-mind training meditation in patients with schizophrenia, Tang et al. (2018) found increased white matter tract integrity connecting the vACC and dACC [ ]. Using different musical and nonmusical emotion-stimuli, Lepping et al. (2016) found that patient with MDD showed the strongest activation by negative nonmusical stimuli and less activation for positive musical in the dACC after each stimulus, while the HC group exhibited greater dACC activation in response to all music than to all nonmusical stimuli [ ]. Regardless of whether an intervention is long-term or short-term, previous studies have reported that mindfulness-based therapy can improve cognitive functioning. However, we did not find a change in dACC and SFG FC after BMRMI in the MDD group, most likely because our intervention comprised a single brief session of BMRMI. In the future, we will implement a complete treatment routine and collect the relevant clinical measurements to further investigate the effect of BMRMI intervention and expand our understanding in mechanism of MDD. 

We also found decreased FC between the left dACC and right MFG in the MDD group after BMRMI compared to baseline. The MFG is a major part of dorsolateral PFC, which is a component of the executive control network and involved in extensive attentional regulation, decision-making, and semantic processing [ ]. Lepping and colleagues have reported that patients with MDD showed a smaller response to positive music in the dACC [ ]. Our results extend this work and indicate that patients with MDD show a blunt response to positive emotional stimuli and require more attention and/or executive control to control competing negative information. 

### 4.1. Strengths 
  
First, the main objective of this study was not only to determine differences in FC between patients with MDD and HCs but also to identify the specificity of these aberrant FC patterns of ACC subregions observed in neuroimaging studies. Second, our results further confirmed the relationship between depressive rumination and attentional control impairments. Third, this study was defined as a preliminary study to investigate the possible effects of BMRMI in MDD with rumination, which could provide some basic data for assessing the long-term intervention in future studies. 


### 4.2. Limitations 
  
The present study has several limitations. First of all, the sample size is relatively small; we will expand the sample size to improve the reliability of data. Second, the total scanning duration was only 144 time points; in the future, we will use a longer sequence to improve measurement reliability (Birn et al., 2013). Third, only one routine therapy session was implemented in our study. Fourth, we did not measure rumination or depression severity after BMRMI treatment, so we could not ascertain whether FC changes in ACC subregions were associated with the changes of symptoms in MDD. Future studies should implement a complete treatment routine and collect the relevant clinical measurements after treatment. It would be meaningful to conduct a longitudinal study to investigate whether the altered FC in brain networks can predict the clinical outcome of BMRMI. 



## 5. Conclusions 
  
Our findings demonstrate that an altered FC between the dACC and SFG is involved in rumination pathophysiology in patients with MDD. Furthermore, we found that BMRMI could positively improve the functional hub of the dACC through modulating attentional control in patients with MDD with rumination. Our results may provide an objective evidence supporting the effect of BMRMI intervention in regulating self-referential processing and in cognitive functioning.

Heavy episodic drinking is prevalent among young adults and is a public issue of increasing importance. Its initiation and maintenance are associated with deficits in the capacity to inhibit automatic processing in favor of non-habitual responses. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine behavioral and brain activity indices of cognitive control during the Stroop task as a function of binge drinking. Heavy episodic drinkers (HED) reported consuming 5+/6+ drinks in two hours at least five times in the past six months and were compared to light drinkers (LED) who reported two or fewer binge episodes but were matched on demographics, intelligence and family history of alcoholism. Greater conflict-induced activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and thalamus was observed in HED participants and it was positively correlated with alcohol intake and alcohol-related harmful consequences. HEDs maintained intact accuracy but at a cost of prolonged reaction times to high-conflict trials and increased ratings of task difficulty. Greater activation of the areas implicated in cognitive control is consistent with compensatory network expansion to meet higher cognitive demands. These results provide further insight into degradation of cognitive control in HEDs which may benefit development of detection and prevention strategies. 
 "," 
## 1. Introduction 
  
Cognitive control is a facet of executive functioning that underlies optimization of behavior by integrating appropriate response selection with previous experiences and current goals [ , , , , ]. These top-down influences have been explored with tasks that probe decision making under conditions that induce response interference and selective inhibition [ , , ]. Extensive neuroimaging literature has characterized the predominantly frontal cortical network comprised of the anterior cingulate, ventrolateral (VLPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), insula, as well as the parietal cortex and basal ganglia [ , , , , , , , , ]. The neurofunctional system subserving cognitive control is particularly vulnerable to the effects of both acute alcohol intoxication [ , , ] and long-term excessive alcohol use [ , , , ]. Structural imaging studies indicate that alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with compromised white matter tracts, reductions in hippocampal volume, and decreases in cortical thickness [ , , , , , ]. These measures are predictive of clinical outcomes such as the duration of abstinence after treatment [ ]. Results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using executive tasks are less consistent with some studies showing decreased [ , , ], and others reporting increased activation in participants with AUD compared with controls [ , , , , , , ]. Activation increase in AUD participants is commonly observed in the absence of executive task performance deficits suggesting that compensatory mechanisms are engaged to maintain normative behavioral performance especially on tasks imposing higher cognitive demands. 

Heavy episodic drinking (HED), also termed binge drinking, is a variation of alcohol use characterized by high volume drinking episodes interspersed with periods of low or no intake. It has been on the rise especially among young and emerging adults, raising serious concerns about the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on a large scale [ ]. Neurobiologically based accounts of addiction conceptualize HED as a stage in an addiction cycle comprised of withdrawal periods followed by active alcohol seeking/craving behaviors [ , , ]. While acute alcohol-induced pharmacological effects result in enhanced neural inhibition overall [ , ], protracted periods of heavy episodic drinking elicit neuroadaptive changes to compensate for alcohol’s effects on the brain [ , ]. This is reflected in neural hyperexcitability and associated with symptoms of withdrawal, dysphoria and increased risk of relapse and dependence [ , , , ]. Evidence is accumulating in support of the “continuum hypothesis” where HED may serve as a precursor to AUD [ , , ]. Structural imaging studies have shown that the effects of HED are particularly deleterious during critical stages of brain development and frontal lobe maturation in adolescence and emerging young adulthood [ , , , ]. Furthermore, HED is associated with impaired executive functions [ , , , ]. Neuroimaging studies of cognitive control functions, however, have reported mixed results with HED participants showing decreased fMRI activation on response inhibition [ , ]. Conversely, increased activation during response inhibition was observed in heavy drinking adolescents [ ]. Increased activation in frontal regions was reported with greater reliability during more complex tasks engaging executive functions such as spatial interference [ ] and working memory [ ]. These findings have been interpreted as reflecting compensatory engagement of cortical areas needed to maintain performance accuracy during cognitively demanding tasks. They primarily encompass frontal regions suggesting an underlying dysregulation of cognitive control which is an important factor in the development of AUD. Indeed, deficient self-regulation can contribute to the formation of habitual, compulsive alcohol consumption resulting in impaired capacity to refrain from drinking [ , , , , , , ]. 

Despite the prevalence of HED and its importance for public health, there is a paucity of studies on the associated harmful consequences in the neurocognitive domain. Most studies report no deficits in intelligence or on task performance in HED indicating that more sensitive neuroimaging measures are needed to characterize deficits associated with binge drinking patterns [ , , ]. Given the importance of cognitive control for the development of AUD, the aim of the present study was to examine its neural underpinnings and possible emerging signs of excessive drinking habits in HED. Cognitive control is commonly probed with tasks that involve inhibition of automatic responses in favor of those that are task-relevant but non-habitual [ , ]. Participants performed a version of the color-Stroop response conflict task, which has been shown to elicit conflict interference with high sensitivity to alcohol intoxication effects [ , ], during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). HED and matched light episodic drinkers (LED) were compared on behavioral and brain indices of response conflict in the context of a comprehensive set of questionnaires on alcohol-related behaviors, dispositional traits, personality, and intelligence measures. 


## 2. Materials and Method 
  
### 2.1. Research Participants 
  
Thirty-one healthy, right-handed young adults (18 female, age 24.7 ± 3.9) participated in the study. They had no history of seizures, traumatic brain injury or concussions, no neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders, vision or hearing problems, and they all complied with MRI safety criteria. Participants were medication-free, they reported using no drugs or tobacco products for at least one month prior to the study and none had previously sought or been enrolled in alcohol abuse treatment. Based on the screening information on alcohol consumption rate, frequency and pattern, participants were assigned to heavy episodic drinking group (HED,   n   = 14) if they reported engaging in ≥5 binge episodes in the previous six months. Light episodic drinking (LED) group comprised individuals who had ≤2 binge episodes in that interval. A binge episode was defined as consuming 5+/6+ drinks for women/men within a two-hour time frame based on research evidence indicating that it is likely to reach a legal level of intoxication (0.08%) [ , ]. The two groups were matched on age, gender, education and family history of alcoholism (see   for group characteristics). The HED group scored higher on a wide range of alcohol-related variables, higher motor impulsivity [ ], and disinhibition and boredom symptoms [ ] ( ). Young adults were recruited from the San Diego area with flyers and on-line postings. All subjects gave written informed consent to experimental procedures approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards. Participants were provided monetary compensation for their participation. 


### 2.2. Experimental Protocol 
  
All participants provided information on multiple dimensions of their alcohol use, such as the severity of their alcohol habit (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, AUDIT) [ ]; the prevalence of particular signs of alcohol misuse (Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, SMAST) [ ]; the number and characteristics of drinking occasions that had occurred over the past thirty days (The Time Line Follow Back, TLFB) [ ]; the degree to which they crave alcohol (The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale, PACS) [ ]; the reasons for engaging in drinking episodes (Drinking Motive Questionnaire Revised Short Form, DMQ-R SF) [ ]; quantifying the occurrence of consequences from drinking (Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire, B-YAACQ) [ ]; and personality traits (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, EPQ) [ ]. In addition, we collected information regarding the presence of depressive symptomology (Patient Health Questionnaire, EPQ) [ ]; anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD7) [ ]; the degree of impulsive behavior for motor, attention and non-planning dimensions (Abbreviated Impulsiveness Scale, ABIS) [ ]; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomology (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, ASRS) [ ]; and finally the desire for novel situations and risk-taking behavior (Brief Measure of Sensation Seeking Scale, BSSS) [ ]. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) [ ]. Family history of alcoholism was assessed with a modified version of the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) [ ]. A positive family history for alcoholism (FH+) was defined as having at least one first-degree and one first- or second-degree relative, or at least three second-degree relatives diagnosed with AUD. Statistical analysis between the alcohol use measures, personality scores, and behavioral results were conducted via SPSS 24 [ ]. Prior to scanning, subjects were screened for illicit substances via urinary analysis and women were tested for pregnancy and all tested negative. 


### 2.3. Task 
  
Cognitive control processes were probed with a modified Stroop color naming task [ , , ]. The subjects were instructed to identify the color of the font (red, green, blue or yellow) and respond as quickly and accurately as possible with index and middle fingers of both hands mapped to four buttons ( ). In the congruent (CONG) condition, the color of the font matched the meaning of the color word, whereas in the incongruent (INCONG) condition the color of the font was different from the color word, inducing interference. To maintain reading dominance and automaticity, additional color words were presented in gray font and the subject responded to the meaning of the word (READ) ( ). The Stroop task was presented as a randomized event-related design and consisted of 540 stimuli across four runs comprising 20% (108) CONG, 20% (108) INCONG and 60% (324) READ trials. Words were presented for a stim duration of 300 ms followed by a 1700 ms fixation (XXXX) period for a total stimulus onset asynchrony of 2 s. In addition, 108 null fixation trials were optimally interleaved with Optseq2 ( ) randomization algorithm to allow for proper finite impulse response (FIR) deconvolution modeling during fMRI analysis [ ]. The task was programmed with Presentation V.19.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems) to sync with the scanner through transistor–transistor (TTL) pulses. 


### 2.4. Image Acquisition and Analysis 
  
Structural and functional imaging data were collected with a GE Discovery MR750 3.0T whole body scanner equipped with an 8-channel head coil. The head was secured with a pillow and foam padding to minimize movement and maximize subject comfort. The subject was provided M3 earplugs (EAR Soft FX) to dampen scanner noise and protect hearing. A mirror was attached to the head coil to allow for comfortable viewing of the front-projected display. A high-resolution SPGR (spoiled gradient recalled echo) T1-weighted structural image sequence was acquired for each subject with the following parameters: TR = 7.38 ms, TE = 2.984 ms, flip angle = 8°, field of view (FOV) = 240, matrix 256 × 256, 170 slices, 1.2 mm slice thickness with a 94 × 94 mm in-plane resolution. During task administration, 4 runs of functional whole-brain blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) volumes (648 total) were collected with a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging sequence of 35 interleaved bottom-up 4 mm slices in AC-PC orientation (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 220 mm, matrix 64 × 64, generating a 3.437 × 3.437 mm in-plane resolution). Anatomical and functional volumes were analyzed with AFNI (Analysis of Functional Neuroimages) 17.1.12 [ , ]. AFNI’s Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI; TT_avg152T1) template was used to warp the anatomical and functional datasets to standardized space. Volume registration of the echo planar imaging (EPI) runs was completed by setting the volume with the least number of outlier voxels as the base. A three-dimensional Gaussian kernel (FWHM 8.0) was used to blur the data within each volume and each voxel was scaled to percent signal change before deconvolution was performed. Motion correction was performed by removing TRs exceeding 0.25 mm rotational and translational motion, removing trials in which 25 percent or more of the voxels are considered outliers, and regressing out motion derivatives in deconvolution through six motion parameters and a third-order polynomial for drift. Hemodynamic response function (HRF) was modeled for each trial through AFNI’s version of finite impulse response model (also termed a “tent” function) within a time window from −4 to 12 s with respect to stimulus onset. The contrast matrix was generated by 3dDeconvolve and used for residual maximum likelihood (REML) and generalized least squares (GLSQ) statistical analysis to identify voxels with significant changes [ ]. For group level statistics, the coefficients and corresponding   t  -values generated from individual REML analysis were used for mixed-effects meta-analysis (MEMA). Cluster simulations were performed via 3dClustSim at the group level to adjust for multiple comparisons and to keep   p  -values below 0.05. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed to identify the pattern of BOLD activation at anatomical locations associated with the task paradigm in order to contrast activity between heavy and light episodic drinkers. ROIs were chosen from an uncorrelated orthogonal general linear model (GLM) contrast (all conditions v. fixation periods) activation map across all subjects [ , ]. The selected anatomical locations contained active voxels clusters at a   p <   0.0001 threshold corrected for multiple testing and family-wise error (FWE) via 3dClustSim. Beta weights representing percent signal change at each point in the time series were extracted from the ROIs for each subject. Time courses were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA with drinking Group as a between-group factor and Condition as a within-subject factor. 



## 3. Results 
  
### 3.1. Drinking and Personality Variables 
  
Group characteristics are displayed in  . HED and LED groups were equated on age, education, GPA, gender, family history of alcoholism, and intelligence. HED participants had higher scores on all alcohol-related variables compared to LEDs. They reported higher numbers of drinking days, more drinks per occasion, binge episodes and blackouts in the previous six months. HEDs also reported more alcoholism-related symptoms, higher alcohol cravings and more harmful consequences from drinking. They reported using alcohol as a coping strategy, to enhance their experience in social situations, and because they enjoyed the euphoria it caused. On average, HED participants started drinking around the age of sixteen, two years earlier than LEDs. In contrast, no differences between groups were detected in anxiety, depression, ADHD-like symptoms or personality measures of psychoticism, neuroticism and extraversion. However, HED individuals reported higher motor impulsivity, boredom susceptibility, and disinhibition. In addition, they rated the Stroop task as being more difficult than LEDs. 


### 3.2. Task Performance 
  
Accuracy and reaction times were analyzed with a mixed-model ANOVA with the factors of Group and Condition. As shown in  , there was a main effect of Condition on task accuracy (  F   = 27.04,   p   < 0.001) and reaction time (  F   = 269,   p   < 0.0001), confirming that the task successfully elicited the Stroop interference effect. The groups did not differ on accuracy (  F   = 0.22,   p   = 0.61) but overall accuracy was the lowest on the INCONG trials compared to both the CONG (  F   = 33.0,   p   < 0.0001) and READ (  F   = 27.38,   p   < 0.0001) trials. Similarly, reaction times (RT) were the longest on the INCONG trials (M = 923 ms), followed by READ (M = 753 ms) and CONG (M = 721 ms), with all conditions differing from each other (  p  ’s < 0.0001). A significant Condition x Group interaction for RT (  F   = 5.44,   p   < 0.01) was driven by the HED individuals responding with significantly slower response times to INCONG stimuli (  F   = 4.22,   p   < 0.05) relative to LEDs ( ). There were no significant task performance differences between men and women. Altogether, this indicates that regardless of gender HEDs were particularly sensitive to response conflict. Indeed, the interference effect, calculated as the RT difference between INCONG and CONG conditions, was positively correlated with all drinking measures (  p  ’s < 0.05). Stroop task difficulty was positively correlated with binge frequency (r  = 0.55,   p   = 0.002), average drinks per occasion (r  = 0.43,   p   = 0.02, and the AUDIT (r  = 0.46,   p   = 0.013). 


### 3.3. Neuroimaging Results 
  
As shown in  , voxel-wise analysis of the peak activation showed a distributed activation pattern which is broadly consistent with previous studies. The task conditions activated inferior precentral, anterior ventrolateral prefrontal, sensorimotor, parietal, occipital cortices and the insula laterally, and the supplementary/presupplementary cortex and the thalamus medially. A robust main effect of Condition with stronger activation to INCONG compared to CONG and READ trials was observed across most association fronto-parietal activated areas but not in the precentral, sensorimotor, and visual cortices ( ,  ). Extracted ROI time series were statistically assessed via mixed-model ANOVA and presented in percent signal change values ( ,  ). The largest effects of Group were observed in the VLPFC and the thalamus bilaterally. INCONG trials elicited stronger activity in HED in both the VLPFC (  F   = 13.4,   p   < 0.001) and left thalamus (  F   = 5.3,   p   < 0.05) relative to LED (  and  ). Similar to the behavioral results there were no significant gender differences in the ROI analysis. 

Nonparametric correlations of Spearman’s Rho were calculated between alcohol measures and extracted time courses for ROI peak activations across groups. Bilateral peak activation of the VLPFC to INCONG trials was positively correlated with binge episodes, blackouts, and the SMAST and AUDIT alcohol severity measures (  p  ’s < 0.02). Peak activation of the left thalamus elicited by INCONG trials was positively correlated with binge episodes (r  = 0.38,   p   = 0.035). There was a significant positive relationship between the rVLPFC and Stroop difficulty during both CONG (r  = 0.43,   p   = 0.023) and INCONG (r  = 0.466,   p   = 0.013) trials. Finally, when parsing apart Groups, HED individuals have a positive correlation between the rVLPFC with non-planning impulsivity (r  = 0.601,   p   = 0.03) during INCONG trials. 



## 4. Discussion 
  
This study used fMRI to investigate behavioral and brain activity indices of cognitive control in heavy and light episodic drinkers during response conflict evoked by the Stroop task. As expected, the high conflict (INCONG) condition evoked greater activity in the fronto-parietal association cortices. Importantly, this activation was greater for HEDs in the VLPFC and thalamus bilaterally relative to LEDs. Conflict-induced activity in the bilateral VLPFC was positively correlated with levels of alcohol intake including binge episodes and the number of drinks consumed per occasion, as well as measures of alcoholism-related symptoms (AUDIT, SMAST) and blackouts. Reported binge episodes were further correlated with activity in the left thalamus. In the absence of accuracy deficits, HEDs had significantly slower RTs to INCONG stimuli, which presumably allowed them to maintain performance levels on par with LEDs. HEDs were particularly affected by response conflict as both the Stroop interference effect and task difficulty ratings were associated with alcohol intake measures. Taken together, these results suggest that heavy episodic drinkers benefit from engaging an expanded cognitive control network and responding more slowly to resolve stimulus conflict. These effects are especially pronounced in those with heavier drinking patterns and more binge episodes which may be indicative of the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol use. 

Binge drinking participants in the present study were young, healthy individuals who showed no cognitive deficits on a standardized intelligence scale. Nonetheless, the observed group differences in brain activity are consistent with those found in AUD samples. Increased activity of the VLPFC has been reported on tasks probing working memory [ , , ], response inhibition [ ], and delay discounting [ ]. Our results are most in line with the findings by Wilcox and colleagues [ ] who used a multisensory Stroop and observed bilateral VLPFC hyperactivation and an overall increase in RTs in AUD participants compared to the control group. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies investigating cognitive control in binge drinkers, the results that have emerged are also similar to those found in AUD. Increased activity of the VLPFC has been reported on a task probing spatial interference [ ] and declarative memory in young adult heavy drinkers [ ]. A study of spatial working memory in adolescents reported greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus in male but not female adolescent binge drinkers [ ]. Moreover, on the Eriksen flanker task, increased activity was induced by response conflict in the VLPFC under acute intoxication in social drinkers [ ]. Inconsistent reports notwithstanding [ , , ], accruing neuroimaging evidence indicates frontal hyperactivation in AUD and binge drinkers compared to low-drinking control groups. More studies are needed to corroborate these findings, but it appears that greater inferior frontal activation is elicited by tasks that impose higher demands on cognitive control by relying on deliberative functions and multidimensional contingencies [ ]. 

This converging evidence is consistent with compensatory accounts of increased engagement across cognitive and emotional neurofunctional systems in alcoholism [ , , , , ]. Extensive functional imaging evidence suggests that the VLPFC is activated by tasks probing cognitive control [ ]. It has been proposed as a key area for inhibitory control of inappropriate motor responses [ , ] but it is also activated during attentional capture [ ] and domain-general tasks that are cognitively demanding but that do not rely on inhibition [ , ]. Meta analyses have provided further insights into functional specificity within the VLPFC subregions [ ]. However, it is increasingly clear that the VLPFC is an integral part of a network that is engaged by a range of tasks imposing attentional demands in the context of processing novelty, contingency monitoring and conflict resolution [ , , ]. Functional connectivity studies have revealed extensive connections of the VLPFC with other parts of the lateral frontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, parietal, and temporal cortices [ ]. Therefore, in response to increased demands imposed by multi-rule tasks, the VLPFC is likely to be recruited in a process of flexible network reconfiguration [ ]. On that view, the brain functions as a dynamic, interactive system that handles changing environmental demands via targeted, yet flexible and integrated engagement of the relevant neurofunctional networks in order to optimize responding [ ]. These networks interact across spatiotemporal scales, they are synchronized from local, specialized, to global-level networks and reflect typical [ ] and pathological changes [ ]. In the present study, greater activation of the VLPFC was elicited by response conflict selectively in HEDs and correlated with Stroop difficulty ratings. Furthermore, both of these variables were associated with various measures of alcohol intake and harmful drinking consequences. Therefore, the converging evidence suggests that in HEDs the task demands exceeded the normative network capacity, necessitating compensatory engagement of the VLPFC and adjustment of response strategy. The observed activation increase is associated with heavy alcohol intake and may reflect adaptation of the brain’s functional networks to the sequelae of heavy drinking. This interpretation is consistent with evidence indicating an expansion of primarily frontal networks in AUD. Muller-Oehring and colleagues [ ] examined functional connectivity in sober alcoholics compared to matched controls during wakeful rest and reported expanded attention/salience network which comprised the inferior frontal cortex. The compensatory interpretation is supported by the correlation between better task performance and network enlargement [ ]. Not all studies, however, show increased activity in brain regions implicated in cognitive control. Decreased activation has been reported in studies with simpler contingencies that rely on response inhibition such as the go/no go and stop signal tasks [ , , ]. These tasks may not be challenging enough to generate high conflict and may not engage cognitive control at the level that would necessitate activation of additional areas [ ]. The present results could serve as an indirect indication of impaired cognitive control in HED individuals. 

Overwhelming evidence indicates that cognitive control is subserved by a distributed, but predominantly frontal, cortical network [ , , , ]. It has been established that AUD is associated with a range of impairments in the cognitive domain and neurophysiological changes in the frontal lobes [ , , , ]. This degradation of prefrontal functions results in impaired decision making and self-control which further contribute to the development of alcohol dependence [ , , , ]. The Stroop task probes top-down regulation by necessitating the suppression of prepotent responses in favor of controlled processing. The sensitivity of prefrontal regions to the effects of acute alcohol on response interference has been shown in previous imaging studies [ , ]. Results of the present study additionally indicate cognitive control deficits in young adult HEDs. This supports existing evidence that self-control impairments can contribute to excessive drinking [ , , ]. Indeed, automatic modes of processing are associated with the increased risk of heavy alcohol use [ ], its maintenance across time [ ], and relapse in abstinent alcoholics [ ]. 

Our study revealed group differences in thalamic activity with HEDs showing greater sensitivity to response interference. The increased activation was positively correlated with the number of binge episodes. Similar results were reported by Campanella and colleagues [ ], with increased thalamic activity in HEDs during working memory in association with drinking levels. In alcohol-dependent participants, increased thalamic activity was observed during an auditory go/nogo [ ] and multisensory Stroop task [ ], but lower activity during working memory [ ]. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the thalamus plays a modulatory role in integrating activity across different levels of the neuraxis and that it contributes to cognitive control and flexible action selection [ , , , , ]. In the present study, HED participants not only exhibited greater thalamic activity, but they also rated the task as being significantly more difficult and responded with longer RTs than the LED subjects indicating that the task imposed increased cognitive demands. It is likely that the increased difficulty was accompanied by heightened arousal [ , ] which is in part subserved by the thalamus [ , ]. Another possibility is that the increased activation of the thalamus reflects neuroadaptive changes resulting from frequent bouts of heavy drinking [ , ]. The thalamus is sensitive to long-term excessive alcohol use and is implicated in a range of deficits across distributed neural circuits [ ]. Smaller thalamic volumes are predictive of subsequent relapse and alcohol intake in chronic alcoholics [ ]. Thalamic hyperactivity could, therefore, reflect its sensitivity to protracted heavy use and its compensatory engagement during increased response conflict difficulty [ ]. 

Measures of impulsivity and disinhibition were positively correlated with alcohol intake variables in the present study, confirming well-established associations between AUD and traits of impulsivity, hyperactivity, and sensation/novelty seeking [ , , , ]. Dysregulation of impulse control underlies the inability to maintain inhibitory control over drinking, which has been considered fundamental to addiction [ , , , , ]. Findings suggest that the vulnerability to alcoholism shares a common genetic component with a cluster of impulsivity traits that may predispose individuals to AUD [ , , ]. Recent evidence converges on dopaminergic modulation of impulsive behavior [ , ], suggesting that the same genetic pathways may mediate both addiction and impulsivity [ , ]. Overall, these findings are strongly suggestive of shared genetic vulnerability to AUD and externalizing traits. The present study cannot speak to the issue of possible pre-existing characteristics of the HED sample unrelated to drinking levels that may have resulted in the observed group differences. However, the behavioral and brain activity findings are correlated with a range of alcohol intake measures. 

Moreover, findings across different studies indicate that the compensatory activity increase may reflect deficits as a function of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. In a working memory task, Campanella and colleagues [ ] reported positive correlation between alcohol consumption and activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in binge drinkers. Wetherill and colleagues [ ] tracked the development of alcohol habits in young adults and similarly reported a positive relationship between alcohol-induced blackouts and increased prefrontal on a response inhibition task. In a study of alcohol-dependent participants, lifetime alcohol consumption was predictive of activity in the posterior cingulate cortex and midbrain during a multisensory Stroop task [ ]. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the disinhibitory traits are implicated in drinking initiation and maintenance via impaired self-control, but that the group differences in neural function may at least in part reflect alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. 

The development of addiction is an exceedingly complex process mediated by environmental risk factors, and interindividual variability [ ] due in part to a person’s genetic makeup [ , , , , ]. However, heavy episodic drinking is associated with deficits in neural functioning in response to conflict-inducing situations with increased vulnerability in adolescents and emerging adults [ , , ]. These neural compromises are often not detectable by behavioral measures but can be revealed by measures of neural function [ , , ] and may signify early trajectory toward compulsive intake characterizing AUD [ , , ]. Given that individuals who engage in most hazardous binge drinking are young and vulnerable to neurotoxicity, it is of paramount importance to better understand the neural indices associated with excessive drinking. Such insights may inform development of therapeutic, personally tailored approaches and prevention strategies.

We investigated adolescent brain processing of decisions under conditions of varying risk, reward, and uncertainty. Adolescents (  n   = 31) preformed a Decision–Reward Uncertainty task that separates decision uncertainty into behavioral and reward risk, while they were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral risk trials involved uncertainty about which action to perform to earn a fixed monetary reward. In contrast, during reward risk the decision that might lead to a reward was known, but the likelihood of earning a reward was probabilistically determined. Behavioral risk trials evoked greater activation than the reward risk and no risk conditions in the anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, bilateral frontal poles, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, bilateral superior-middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and insula. Our results were similar to those of young adults using the same task (Huettel,  ) except that adolescents did not show significant activation in the posterior supramarginal gyrus during behavioral risk. During the behavioral risk condition regardless of reward outcome, overall mean frontal pole activity showed a positive correlation with age during the behavioral and reward risk conditions suggesting a developmental difference of this region of interest. Additionally, reward response to the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task in adolescents was similar to that seen in young adults (Huettel,  ). Our data did not show a correlation between age and mean ventral striatum activity during the three conditions. While our results came from a healthy high functioning non-maltreated sample of adolescents, this method can be used to address types of risks and reward processing in children and adolescents with predisposing vulnerabilities and add to the paucity of imaging studies of risk and reward processing during adolescence.

## Introduction 
  
Adolescence represents a period of decision making that involves increased risk taking. Risk taking is defined as engaging in behaviors that may be high in subjective desirability (i.e., associated with high perceived reward) but which expose the individual to potential injury or loss (Geier and Luna,  ). Examples of adolescent risk-taking include initiating use of alcohol and other addictive drugs (resulting in addiction) or engaging in unprotected sex (resulting in teenage pregnancies). The known increases in adolescent risk behaviors are observed across cultures (Spear,  ) and associated with less mature prefrontal inhibitory control circuits (Ernst et al.,  ). Adolescent risk taking is a major public health concern whose negative results can lead to impaired maternal–infant interactions due to addictions and/or teen parenting. However, some risk taking may be normative, in that it allows for exploration of adult roles and for development of relevant coping skills (Siegel and Shaughnessy,  ; Spear,  ; Dahl,  ; Kelley et al.,  ; Geier and Luna,  ). Consequently, the neurobiological study of adolescent decision and reward processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is timely. 

Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that adolescents exhibit less activation in executive brain regions during decision making in gambling tasks than adults, which suggests an immaturity of these regions during adolescence (Eshel et al.,  ; Ernst and Mueller,  ). In this investigation, we examined the neurodevelopmental maturity of adolescents using a novel task designed to challenge the dorsal lateral prefrontal executive control and ventral medial prefrontal reward circuits (Huettel,  ). This Decision–Reward Uncertainty task separates decisions into behavioral risk and reward risk (Huettel,  ). The Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task represents an innovative approach to understanding decision making and reward. While most decision-making tasks used in addiction research combine decision making, response, and reward evaluation in time, the Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task was designed to examine decision making and reward circuits separately in one task (see Figure  ). Decision-making circuits involve a set of brain structures: prefrontal cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; parietal cortex; insular cortex; and anterior and posterior cingulate (Paulus et al.,  ; Huettel,  ). Reward circuits involve a set of brain structures that receive dopaminergic input from the midbrain and include the ventral striatum (Vstr; which includes the nucleus accumbens), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Schott et al.,  ). 
  
 (A)   Geometric shape cues, button press response(s), and probabilities of reward for each risk condition. No risk cues (left button press on right hand for a star, or right button press on right hand for a square) signaled that the known behavioral response would be rewarded with 100% certainty. Reward risk cues (right button press for a trapezoid, or left button press for a circle) signaled that the known behavioral response would be rewarded with 50% probability. However, the behavioral risk cue (a triangle) signaled that the behavioral response was unknown; on each trial, either one of the two possible responses would be guaranteed a reward (“$ or $$ (not shown))” while the other would not.   (B)   Sequence of events used in each trial of the reward uncertainty task. A shape cue marked the start of each trial. After a fixed interval, a response prompt was presented. Participants were asked to press one of two buttons using their right hand as soon as the prompt appeared to make their choice. The outcome of each trial was determined by both (a) a correct right or left button response and (b) a probabilistically determined reward. Thus, each trial began with a shape cue for 250 ms in the center of the screen that indicated the trial type. After a 3-s delay, participants were prompted (i.e., “?”) for 1 s to indicate their choice with a left or right button press with the second or third finger on the right hand. After a jittered delay (1, 3, 5, or 7 s) where the fixation cross was presented, the trial outcome (reward: “$” for no and reward risk, reward: “$$”(not shown here) for behavioral risk, or no reward: “×”) was presented for 1 s, and an updated tally of cumulative earnings was displayed in the lower portion of the screen. A fixation cross was displayed in the center of the screen during a jittered inter-trial interval (2, 4, 6, or 8 s). Participants completed 150 trials on average, split evenly among six 6-min runs. Optimal performance could yield up to an additional $25 (e.g., $0.15 per correct response; for one dollar sign; $0.30 for two dollar signs). 
  
The Decision–Reward Uncertainty task is an advance because most previous research failed to differentiate decisions into risk types (i.e., reward risk versus behavioral risk) and reward response (Bolla et al.,  ; Huettel et al.,  ; Verdejo-Garcia et al.,  ) Thus, in most studies, decision making (also called response selection) was contingent in time upon reward and not separated from reward delivery (Xiangrui et al.,  ). Reward risk is defined as certainty about behavior but uncertainty about possible outcomes (i.e., reward presence). In other words, one knows what actions to take for a reward but the probability of reward is not certain. Reward risk activates reward circuits in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and other subcortical components of reward networks (Huettel,  ). Behavioral risk is defined as uncertainty about which decisions and actions should be taken to earn a reward or achieve a desired goal. Under these conditions, one does not know what actions to take for a reward. The Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task examines three types of risk: reward risk, behavioral risk, and no risk. In reward risk trials, the action required to earn a reward is known, but the outcome of each trial is probabilistic. In behavioral risk trials, there is limited knowledge about which action to take (i.e., button to press), and the participant chooses between two possible button presses, one of which randomly determines a reward on that trial. The only difference between these conditions is whether a subject knows the correct action (reward risk) or not (behavioral risk). In other words, in reward risk, the decision and action to take are certain and in behavioral risk, the decision and action to take are uncertain. The Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task includes a no risk or certainty condition as a control, where the action required to earn a reward is known and reward is certain. 

While undergoing the Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task during the behavioral risk condition, healthy young adults activated executive-control circuits including the prefrontal, parietal, and insular regions, within which no effect of reward risk was observed (Huettel,  ), Reward delivery, in comparison to no reward, evoked increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the Vstr which includes the nucleus accumbens (Huettel,  ). In healthy young adults undergoing this task, reward risk activated nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex suggesting that distinct brain systems are recruited for the resolution of these different forms of risk (Huettel,  ). 

However, the Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task results were derived from samples of young-adult participants, and it is not clear whether they generalize to adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex is actively undergoing maturational changes. Indeed, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex completes its pruning of gray matter only toward the end of adolescence (Gogtay et al.,  ). Consequently, conclusions about decision processes derived from adult samples may not generalize well to adolescents. Given the differences in behavior and levels of brain maturation in adolescents and adults, an important question for current research is whether these differences are evident in both behavioral and reward risk, and their brain circuitry regions of interest. To date, previous studies have not investigated how different types of risk are represented in adolescent executive and reward networks. This is a potentially important distinction, because it may have social and policy implications. We hypothesize that in adolescents, behavioral risk will activate executive-control circuits their associated functional regions of interests while reward risk will activate reward circuits and their associated functional regions of interest as suggested in the Huettel ( ) study. However, in this study, we wished to examine in adolescents the neural correlates of decision making with respect to reward and behavioral risks. Furthermore, we predict an association with executive control and reward circuits regions of interest and age. 


## Materials and Methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Thirty-one healthy adolescents (mean age and SD: 15.5 ± 1.5 years; age range: 12.3–17.7 years; 21 females, 10 males) participated in a detailed clinical research assessment, and then engaged in the Decision–Reward Uncertainty Task while undergoing fMRI on another day. There were no gender or age differences (mean age females 15.5 ± 1.6, mean age males 15.6 ± 1.2 years:   F   = 0.01, df = 21,   p   = 0.94) in the control group. Healthy adolescent participants were recruited from the community by IRB approved advertisements. Adolescents provided written assent and legal guardians provided written informed consent before participation. Male and females did not differ in handedness, IQ, or socioeconomic status. All participants came from a range of socioeconomic environments (middle to upper socioeconomic strata). 

The clinical assessment portion of the study was undertaken at the Healthy Childhood Brain Development Developmental Traumatology Research Program and included interviews of both adolescents and their legal guardians using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL), which includes a comprehensive post-traumatic stress disorder interview (Kaufman et al.,  ). This semi-structured interview was administered to caregivers and adolescents. We also used archival records as additional sources of information. The KSADS-PL was modified to include additional information about: (1) life events, including traumatic events from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (Angold et al.,  ); and (2) disorders not present in the KSADS-PL. Modifications also included: (3) an added structured scale to quantify symptom frequency with a minimum score of 0 = no history of a symptom and maximum score of 10 = symptoms present several times a day; and (4) algorithms to determine Axis I psychiatric disorders based on DSM-IV criteria. Disorders were assigned a severity score of mild, moderate, or severe. This modified version is available upon request. Interviewers were individually trained to obtain over 90% agreement for the presence of any lifetime major Axis I disorder with a board certified child and adolescent psychiatrist and experienced child trauma interviewer (MDDB). Discrepancies were resolved by reviewing archival information (e.g., school records, birth, and pediatric medical records) or by re-interviewing the child or caregiver. If diagnostic disagreements were not resolved with this method, consensus diagnoses were reached among a child psychiatrist (MDDB) and child psychologist (SRH). Subjects also underwent extensive neuropsychological testing to verify that they were age-typical. This included a two-subtest short-form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III; Wechsler,  ) comprised of Vocabulary and Block Design, to generate an IQ score. Mean IQ was 113.1 ± 11.0 (IQ range 90–132). Adolescents also received saliva and urine toxicology screens to confirm the absence of alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use on the day of interview and imaging data collection. Participants with an Axis I diagnosis, who were not age-typical on neuropsychological testing or had a positive alcohol or drug screen, were excluded. 

Exclusion criteria for subjects were: (1) current or lifetime history of DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders including alcohol and substance use disorders, (2) significant medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder, (3) history of head injury or loss of consciousness, (4) pregnancy, (5) history of prenatal or birth confounds that could have influenced brain maturation such as significant prenatal exposure to substances, severe birth complications, or birth weight under 5 lb or severe postnatal compromise with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay; (6) morbid obesity or growth failure, (7) full scale IQ lower than 90, (8) history of trauma or child maltreatment, or (9) contraindications to safe participation in MRI research. The Institutional Review Board of the Duke University Medical Center approved this study. 


### Experimental design 
  
We used an experimental paradigm, the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task, that we have used previously to examine neural correlates of risky decision making in young-adult participants (Huettel,  ). Critically, the task was designed to temporally isolate three phases of decision making: (1) choice selection, (2) action execution, and (3) outcome or reward evaluation (Ernst and Paulus,  ; Rangel et al.,  ). Our analyses focus on the initial choice selection and outcome evaluation phases of decision making. 

In this task, we manipulated two types of risk: Reward risk and behavioral risk. In reward risk trials, the action required to earn a reward was known to the participant, but the outcome of each trial was probabilistic: if the correct button was pressed, there was a 50% probability of a reward. In behavioral risk trials, the participant chose between two possible button presses, one of which (randomly determined) guaranteed a reward on that trial. Note that the behavioral risk and reward risk conditions were matched on probability and expected value, in that each contained a 50% chance of receiving a constant-size reward. The only difference between these conditions was in whether the participant knew the correct action (reward risk) or not (behavioral risk). We also included a no risk condition as a control. In the no risk condition, the action required to earn a reward was known and the likelihood of earning a reward was certain. 

Each condition was represented by a visual cue (square, star, circle, trapezoid, or triangle) and mapped directly to a response [left (second digit) or right (third digit) button press with right hand; see Figure  A]. No risk cues (left button press on right hand for a star, or right button press on right hand for a square) signaled that the known behavioral response would be rewarded with 100% certainty. Reward risk cues (right button press for a trapezoid, or left button press for a circle) signaled that the known behavioral response would be rewarded with 50% probability. However, the behavioral risk cue (a triangle) signaled that the behavioral response was unknown; on each trial, either one of the two possible responses would be guaranteed a reward while the other would not. Each trial (Figure  B) began with a shape cue for 250 ms in the center of the screen that indicated the trial type. After a 3-s delay, participants were prompted (i.e., “?”) for 1 s to indicate their choice with a left or right button press with the second or third finger on their right hand. After a jittered delay (1, 3, 5, or 7 s) where the fixation cross was presented, the trial outcome (reward: “$” for no risk, and “$$” for behavioral risk or reward risk, or no reward: “×”) was presented for 1 s, and an updated tally of cumulative earnings was displayed in the lower portion of the screen. A fixation cross was displayed in the center of the screen during a jittered inter-trial interval (2, 4, 6, or 8 s). Participants completed 150 trials on average, split evenly among six 6-min runs. As a developmental adaptation for the younger adolescents, the duration of each run was reduced to six 6-min runs for the adolescent group from the 10 min used in the young-adult group (Huettel,  ). This adaptation greatly improved adolescent cooperation with the task. Optimal performance could yield up to an additional $25 (e.g., $0.15 per correct response; for one dollar sign; $0.30 for two dollar signs) above the regular compensation for participation. Participants were trained on the task’s cue–response contingencies in a prior behavioral testing session before scanning. To minimize practice or learning effects, all subjects practice the task until they showed that they had mastered the rules of the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task. 

The experiment was programmed in MATLAB (MathWorks ) using the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard,  ). Stimuli were displayed on goggles at a video resolution of 800 × 600 pixels and an apparent field of view of approximately 20°. Responses were collected on a four-button box, where only the first two buttons were used. 


### Image acquisition 
  
The fMRI data for our adolescent participants were acquired using a 3.0-T General Electric (Waukesha, WI, USA) scanner. Whole-brain images sensitive to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast were acquired using a high-throughput   -weighted spiral-in pulse sequence (TR = 2 s, TE = 28 ms, flip angle = 90°, 34 slices, voxel size: 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm × 3.8 mm). Data were acquired in a series of six sessions, each comprising 180 volumes. We additionally acquired whole-brain high-resolution images using a T -weighted 3D spoiled gradient-recalled sequence to aid in normalization and registration of the functional images. 


### fMRI data analysis 
  
Functional images were analyzed using fMRI Expert Analysis Tool (version 5.98, Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK). These images were corrected for slice acquisition time (interleaved ascending), corrected for motion with MCFLIRT, normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute stereotaxic space (MNI, Montreal, QC, Canada), and subjected to a high-pass filter (pass frequency > 1/100 Hz). FSL’s Brain Extraction Tool (BET) was used to exclude non-brain voxels from our analyses. Four volumes from the start of each session were discarded to allow image intensity to stabilize. First-level (i.e., within-run) regression analyses included three regressors time-locked to the onset of the decision phase, defined as first second from the onset of the stimulus, of each trial type (behavioral risk, reward risk, and no risk), one nuisance regressor for all responses, and one nuisance regressor for missed responses. Second-level analyses collapsed across runs, within each subject, using a fixed-effects model. Across-subjects comparisons used a random-effects model that included an additional regressor for between-group comparisons. All reported results, including figures and tables, show activation that survived a whole-brain cluster family wise error (FWE) correction with a voxelwise   z  -statistic threshold of 2.3 (  p   ≤ 0.01). 

To examine the relationship between maturation and brain region of interests (ROI), we used mean ROI BOLD activity of brain regions which showed significant differences in our third level analyses and correlated these with age using parametric statistics (Pearson’s correlations) and jmp 9.0.2  (2010 SAS Institute Inc). Before Pearson’s correlations were applied, data was tested for fit to the normal distribution using the Goodness of Fit Test (i.e., Shapiro–Wilk   W   Test) in jmp. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioral analysis 
  
Only correct responses performed within a 1-s window after the response prompt (e.g., “?”) was displayed were included in the analyses. Mean response times were analyzed by condition: no risk (Mean = 0.448, SD = 0.082 s), reward risk (Mean = 0.453, SD = 0.082 s), and behavioral risk (Mean = 0.451, SD = 0.091 s). Response times were submitted to a repeated measures analysis of variance and showed no main effect of condition,   F  (2, 29) = 0.373,   p   = 0.692. 


### Regions activated by behavioral risk in adolescents 
  
To identify the brain regions that support decision making under behavioral risk, we contrasted activation associated with decisions in the behavioral risk (i.e., choice selection) condition with the mean activation associated with decisions in the no risk and reward risk conditions. In our adolescent sample this contrast elicited significant activations in brain regions typically implicated in risky decision making: anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, bilateral frontal poles and inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, bilateral superior-middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and insula (Figure,  ; Table   reports the peak voxels present using the   z  -statistic threshold of 2.3). Within these significant cluster of regions also included the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and lateral parietal regions. This pattern of activation replicates the key results from the adult sample described by Huettel ( , indicating that adolescents activated the same decision-making network as adults during decisions involving behavioral risk. Mean percent signal change (SE) associated with the no risk (NR), reward risk (RR), and behavioral risk (BR) conditions are shown in Figure  . Signal was extracted from two regions of interest: (Figure  A) anterior cingulate and (Figure  B) frontal pole.

### Regions activated by outcome evaluation 
  
To distinguish the brain regions that responded to rewarding outcomes from those activated during decisions involving risk, we contrasted trials in both the reward risk and behavioral risk conditions that led to a rewarding outcome with those trials that led to no reward. When using   z  -statistic threshold = 2.3, this contrast elicited large clusters of significant activations in three brain regions; (1) the IFG, middle frontal gyrus, and its sublobar areas; (2) the cingulate gyrus; and (3) the middle occipital gyrus. These include subclusters typically implicated in decision and reward processing: Vstr, which includes the nucleus accumbens and caudate, and putamen, and additionally activated the global pallidus and IFG, middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and large regions in the visual cortex. Because the peak activations in these regions were so large, we manually identified the subcluster in the Vstr and global pallidus. This is shown in Figure  A and Table  .

To examine the evoked activation in response to reward, we extracted the mean percent signal change in both rewarded and unrewarded conditions using an anatomically defined ROI in the Vstr which includes the nucleus accumbens (which was superimposed in green in Figure  A). The nucleus accumbens was based on the standard ROI for the nucleus accumbens subcortical region as defined by the Harvard-Oxford atlas within FSL and is shown in green. Mean percent signal change in response to rewarded and unrewarded outcomes were calculated for each level of risk (Figure  B). 


### Correlations of regions of interest with age 
  
During the behavioral risk condition regardless of reward outcome, overall mean frontal pole BOLD activity showed a positive Pearson’s correlation with age (  F   = 11.4, df = 29,   p   = 0.002). See Figure  A. Reward risk similarly showed a positive Pearson’s correlation with age (  F   = 4.7, df = 29,   p   < 0.04). See Figure  B. These correlations suggest developmental differences during different types of decision making in the frontal pole with increasing age. We did not see significant correlations between age and mean anterior cingulate or mean Vstr BOLD activity with age.

## Discussion 
  
We investigated functional brain activity in high functioning healthy adolescents while they performed the experimental Decision–Reward Uncertainty task (Huettel,  ). We had two primary goals: to evaluate whether adolescents recruited the same decision-making network as young adults, and to examine whether the form of risk modulated these networks. Our goal was also to examine reward circuits and their regions of interest using the same simple task. Furthermore, we wanted to examine the association with executive control and reward circuits regions of interest with maturation measures (e.g., age). Our analyses focused on the decision making or choice selection and outcome evaluation phases of decisions that involved behavioral risk (i.e., decision making under uncertainty). Decision making during the task elicited activation in executive-control regions typically implicated in studies of adult decision making: frontal poles, anterior cingulate, superior, middle and medial prefrontal gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and insula (Huettel,  ). Behavioral risk trials, however, evoked greater activation than the other conditions in the anterior cingulate, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, frontal gyrus, frontal poles, inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, and anterior insula. Our results were similar to those of young adults using the same task (Huettel,  ) except that adolescents did not show significant activation in the posterior supramarginal gyrus, a brain area involved in vocabulary and declarative memory (Lee et al.,  ), during behavioral risk. Our task does involve working memory (Huettel,  ), a process that matures during adolescence. These findings show that choice selection during decisions involving behavioral risk elicits a network of brain regions including those that are involved in conflict monitoring (anterior cingulate; Kerns et al.,  ), visual attention (occipito-parietal cortex; Konrad et al.,  ), working memory and decision making (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Kwon et al.,  ; Huettel et al.,  ; Konrad et al.,  ), and interpreting the emotional significance and the intensity of stimuli (insula; for review see Ernst and Paulus,  ). 

In our results, reward versus no reward elicited significant activations in brain regions typically implicated in decision and reward processing (i.e., Vstr, inferior frontal, gyrus, anterior to middle cingulate, posterior cingulate, and visual cortex). Similar research findings were seen in studies of reward processing in primates (Apicella et al.,  ; Schultz et al.,  ; Roesch and Olson,  ) and adults (O’Doherty et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Elliott et al.,  ). Reward response to the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task was similar to that seen in young adults using this task (Huettel,  ). There are few imaging studies of reward processing during adolescence. Those investigations also implicate neurocircuitry similar to those reported during reward response to the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task here, in that differences in BOLD activity were seen in visual cortex, Vstr, and anterior to middle cingulate during reward processing in adolescents (Bjork et al.,  ,  ; May et al.,  ; Ernst and Paulus,  ; Galvan et al.,  ; Eshel et al.,  ). 

However, the reward response processing during adolescence is controversial, where some investigators believe the adolescent reward processing circuitry is hyporesponsive to rewards compared to those of adults (Spear,  ), while others believe adolescents’ reward circuits are hyperresponsive to rewards compared to adults (Chambers et al.,  ; Ernst et al.,  ). In a hypoactive reward processing system, brain areas that process rewards are not recruited as strongly as they are in adults. Our data did not provide support for this theory in that during the no risk condition, mean Vstr activity showed no positive correlation with age in carefully screened and comprehensively assessed healthy adolescents. 

Decision making and reward processing in clinical populations is vastly understudied. Although speculative, a developmentally decreased sensitivity to executive function such as decision making under conditions of uncertainty may, in vulnerable adolescent populations, contribute to differences in reinforcement-related learning that lead to adolescent onset alcohol and substance use disorders (for review see Spear,  ). For example, adult studies have also shown reduced activation in control and reward processes in abstinent cannabis users (Martin-Santos et al.,  ). Additionally, childhood adverse life events are associated with basal ganglia hyporesponse during fMRI evaluation of reward (Dillon et al.,  ; Mehta et al.,  ) which may further contribute to the known risk for adolescent onset alcohol and substance use disorders seen in victims of maltreatment (Anda et al.,  ; Kilpatrick et al.,  ). Preclinical studies suggest stress in young animals lowers dopamine D2 receptors in reward regions (Papp et al.,  ; Morgan et al.,  ), making animals and humans more vulnerable to addiction (De Bellis,  ). One pediatric study, however, showed that while undergoing The Wheel of Fortune task, maltreated children with depression selected safe over risky options more frequently in the high-risk condition than did control children (i.e., they avoided selecting a large reward paired with a low chance of winning compared with maltreated children without depression and non-maltreated controls; Guyer et al.,  ). These limited data suggest that the effects of early familial adverse experiences or familial vulnerability on development of decision making and reward evaluation require further study as immaturity in executive decision making or reward systems may lead to substance use disorders and thus negatively influence the quality of care an addicted parent is able to provide. 

Adolescence is a period during which the constituents of cognition develop to enable adaptive goal-directed behavior (for review see Ernst and Mueller,  ). However, the emotional intensity also associated with adolescence influences the response to rewards that may contribute to increased risk-taking behaviors. Another model of adolescent reward processing suggests that adolescents demonstrate a heightened sensitivity to rewards and over active reward system. This “triadic model” proposes three behavioral control systems (approach, avoidance, and supervisory control systems) that differ between adolescents and adults (for review see Ernst et al.,  ). In other words, normative maturational increases in dopamine neurotransmitter activity in the fronto-striatal “motivational” system coupled with relatively lower levels of inhibitory (e.g., serotoninergic) mechanisms in prefrontal systems contribute to increased reward sensitivity in adolescents (Chambers et al.,  ) and the known increases in normative adolescent risk behaviors (Dahl,  ; Kelley et al.,  ). Thus the hyper-responsivity reward processing theory suggests that an overactive Vstr is unchecked by immature prefrontal inhibitory mechanisms. In our study, the behavioral and reward risk conditions regardless of reward outcome, showed a positive correlation with age and overall mean frontal pole activity. During the reward risk condition, mean frontal pole activity also showed a positive correlations with age. Our data suggest that the prefrontal system is immature at younger ages regardless of type of risk (behavioral or reward risk) and provide no direct support for the hyper-responsivity reward processing theory. However, immaturity of prefrontal executive supervisory control systems alone may account for dysregulation of reward processing during adolescence. Its activity matures from childhood to adulthood in parallel with increased capacity for adults to make healthy mature decisions (Eshel et al.,  ). 

The relationship between reduced frontal pole activation and younger age during both the behavioral and reward risk conditions may mean that less reinforced risky rewards signal the availability of reinforcement in adolescents. As greater reward was associated with greater risk in this task, a developmentally immature and less active executive system could push adolescents toward greater risk taking. Such an interpretation is consistent with findings from Bjork et al. ( ) which showed adolescents have diminished striatal activation when they are   anticipating   responding for gains, but not upon receipt of reward. Thus, adolescents may experience more risky uncertain intermittent reinforcers as more rewarding compared to adults. The more salient the reward, the more likely a prefrontal dopaminergic response will occur that is sufficient to facilitate the formation of a conditioned association. Hence immaturity in executive-control neuro-maturational systems may put an adolescent at increased risk for substance use disorders and other types of risk-taking behaviors such as suicide attempts (Shaffer and Hicks,  ; Costello et al.,  ). The data reported here are more consistent with the theory of Geier and Luna ( ), which states that adolescent risk taking may be best understood as an imbalance between inhibitory control, working memory, and reward systems that is biased toward short term goals (Geier and Luna,  ). However, while our data do suggest increased activity of the frontal pole with age during decision making, these data do not suggest any association with age and Vstr during reward evaluation. 

Our data have several limitations. We studied only very healthy high functioning adolescents. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to population-based samples. Due to our sample size, we were unable to examine for gender differences. Additionally we did not study adults using the same task parameters so we were unable to directly compare healthy adolescent responses to behavioral risk with those of adults. However, although, we did not do physical examinations for pubertal stage, we were able to associate a proxy measure of maturity (i.e., age) with a decision-making brain ROI. 

While our results came from a healthy high functioning non-maltreated sample of adolescents, they point to the power of using a simple task (i.e., Decision–Reward Uncertainty task) for addressing types of risks and reward processing in children and adolescents with predisposing vulnerabilities. Given that the ability to evaluate risk and reward is a maturational process, it is important to examine the effects of early life stressors on these abilities. Conditions associated with maladaptive decision making and reward evaluation (e.g., substance use disorder) come to the fore during adolescence. A better understanding of the developmental progression of decision and reward networks will lead to more refined targets both for future research and for interventions. 


## Conclusion 
  
We investigated functional brain activity in high functioning healthy adolescents while they performed the experimental Decision–Reward Uncertainty task (Huettel,  ). Our analyses focused on the decision making or choice selection and outcome evaluation phases of decisions that involved behavioral risk (i.e., decision making under uncertainty). Behavioral risk trials evoked greater activation than the reward risk and no risk conditions in the anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral frontal poles and inferior parietal lobes, precuneus, bilateral superior-middle frontal gyrus, IFG, and anterior insula. Our results were similar to those of young adults using the same task during behavioral risk (Huettel,  ). During the behavioral and reward risk conditions regardless of reward outcome, overall mean frontal pole activity showed a positive correlation with age during the behavioral and reward risk conditions suggesting a developmental immaturity of this ROI. Additionally, reward response to the Decision–Reward Uncertainty task in adolescents was similar to that seen in young adults (Huettel,  ). While our results came from a healthy high functioning non-maltreated sample of adolescents, this method (i.e., Decision–Reward Uncertainty task) can be used to address types of risks and reward processing in children and adolescents with predisposing vulnerabilities and add to the paucity of imaging studies of risk and reward processing during adolescence.

## Background 
  
Dysregulation of the μ‐opioid receptor has been reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and was linked to pain severity. Here, we investigated the effect of the functional genetic polymorphism of the μ‐opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) (  rs1799971  ) on symptom severity, pain sensitivity and cerebral pain processing in FM subjects and healthy controls (HC). 


## Methods 
  
Symptom severity and pressure pain sensitivity was assessed in FM subjects (  n   = 70) and HC (  n   = 35). Cerebral pain‐related activation was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging during individually calibrated painful pressure stimuli. 


## Results 
  
Fibromyalgia subjects were more pain sensitive but no significant differences in pain sensitivity or pain ratings were observed between OPRM1 genotypes. A significant difference was found in cerebral pain processing, with carriers of at least one G‐allele showing increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to precentral gyrus, compared to AA homozygotes. This effect was significant in FM subjects but not in healthy participants, however, between‐group comparisons did not yield significant results. Seed‐based functional connectivity analysis was performed with the seed based on differences in PCC/precentral gyrus activation between OPRM1 genotypes during evoked pain across groups. G‐allele carriers displayed decreased functional connectivity between PCC/precentral gyrus and prefrontal cortex. 


## Conclusions 
  
G‐allele carriers showed increased activation in PCC/precentral gyrus but decreased functional connectivity with the frontal control network during pressure stimulation, suggesting different pain modulatory processes between OPRM1 genotypes involving altered fronto‐parietal network involvement. Furthermore, our results suggest that the overall effects of the OPRM1 G‐allele may be driven by FM subjects. 


## Significance 
  
We show that the functional polymorphism of the μ‐opioid receptor gene OPRM1 was associated with alterations in the fronto‐parietal network as well as with increased activation of posterior cingulum during evoked pain in FM. Thus, the OPRM1 polymorphism affects cerebral processing in brain regions implicated in salience, attention, and the default mode network. This finding is discussed in the light of pain and the opioid system, providing further evidence for a functional role of OPRM1 in cerebral pain processing.

## INTRODUCTION 
  
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain, accompanied by tenderness and fatigue, disturbed sleep and psychological distress. FM is considered a nociplastic pain condition (Kosek et al.,  ) accompanied by altered nociception and changes in the central nervous system (Sluka & Clauw,  ). Importantly, FM has been associated with impaired pain inhibition (Kosek & Hansson,  ; Lannersten & Kosek,  ), also displayed in reduced activation of opioid‐rich regions of the pain modulatory system (Jensen et al.,  ,  ). Additionally, elevated endogenous opioids in the cerebrospinal fluid (Baraniuk et al.,  ) could be linked to reduced μ‐opioid receptor (MOR) availability in cerebral pain‐related areas (Harris et al.,  ). The aberration in the opioid system of FM patients is in accordance with the reports of microglia activation (Albrecht et al.,  ), as opioid‐induced hyperalgesia has been associated with glial activation (Roeckel et al.,  ). Finally, the interaction between endogenous opioids and MORs has been found to influence the pain experience (Zubieta et al.,  ) and play a role in chronic pain syndromes (Zorina‐Lichtenwalter et al.,  ), including FM (Schrepf et al.,  ). 

Among pain‐relevant genetic polymorphisms is the MOR gene (OPRM1), which is of interest for pharmacogenetic research investigating opioids. The functional single nucleotide polymorphism A118G   (rs1799971)   of OPRM1 leads to an exchange of asparagine to aspartic acid at amino acid 40 and affects the putative N‐terminal site of the receptor. Although inconsistent findings have been reported, carriers of at least one G‐allele, compared to AA homozygotes, have been shown to exhibit higher receptor affinity for β‐endorphins but not for other endogenous opioids or opioid drugs (Mura et al.,  ). Additionally, the G‐allele has been associated with diminished MOR expression (Bond et al.,  ; Oertel et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ), reduced MOR availability (Oertel et al.,  ; Peciña et al.,  ), as well as decreased MOR G‐protein coupling efficacy and, thus, reduced signalling efficacy (Oertel et al.,  ). The G‐allele has also been associated with reduced analgesic efficacy of opioid drugs (Cajanus et al.,  ; Yu et al.,  ). 

Several studies indicate that the OPRM1 polymorphism affects cognition, as G‐allele carriers exhibit higher reactivity to social rejection (Way et al.,  ), lower placebo‐induced opioid activation (Oertel et al.,  ) and aberrant response to reward in healthy individuals (Lee et al.,  ) and FM subjects (Finan et al.,  ). Moreover, an antagonistic interaction between OPRM1 and serotonin‐related genes on pain modulation was observed. Specifically, exercise‐induced hypoalgesia was pronounced in FM subjects and healthy controls (HC) with the OPRM1 G‐allele combined with genetically inferred weak serotonergic mechanisms (Tour et al.,  ). Taken together, previous studies indicate that the OPRM1 polymorphism exerts an effect in acute and FM pain. 

To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the role of the functional genetic polymorphism of OPRM1 in evoked pain using fMRI in FM subjects. Here, we investigated the effect of OPRM1 (  rs1799971  ) on symptom severity, pain sensitivity, and cerebral processing in FM subjects and HC. 


## METHODS 
  
### Sample 
  
The recruited study sample consisted of 80 FM subjects (mean 47.4 ± 7.9 years) and 40 HC (mean 47.9 ± 7.9 years). Data of one HC and one FM were excluded due to undetermined genotyping (see Section  ). Complete data sets of 79 FM patients and 39 HC were included in the behavioural analyses (  n   = 118). 

Imaging data of 13 participants were excluded from further analysis due to excessive head motion (  n   = 6, see Section  ), structural brain anomalies (  n   = 1), and incomplete data sets due to technical issues and drop‐outs (  n   = 6), resulting in data of 105 participants included in the final fMRI analysis (70 FM subjects and 35 HC). 

All patients underwent systematic screening by a specialist in rehabilitation medicine and pain relief (Dr. Kadetoff) to ensure that the ACR‐1990 as well as the ACR‐2011 classification criteria for FM (Wolfe et al.,  ,  ) were met. Inclusion criteria for patients also included female sex, working age (20–60 years) and right‐handedness. Exclusion criteria consisted of other dominant pain conditions than FM, painful osteoarthritis, rheumatic, or autoimmune diseases, other severe somatic diseases (neurological, cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes mellitus etc.), hypertension (>160/90 mmHg), previous brain or heart surgery, psychiatric disorders including ongoing treatment for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, pregnancy, magnetic implants, self‐reported claustrophobia, obesity (Body Mass Index > 35), smoking (>5 cigarettes/day), inability to speak and understand Swedish, medication with antidepressants or anticonvulsants, inability to refrain from analgesics, NSAID or hypnotics prior to study participation (48 hr before the first visit, and 72 hr before the second visit, that is, the fMRI examination). No FM subjects were on strong opioids. HC were right‐handed women, age‐balanced to FM subjects, and in addition to the listed exclusion criteria for FM patients also free from chronic pain conditions and without regular medications with NSAIDs, analgesics or sleep medication. 

Participants were recruited through advertisement in the daily newspaper. All participants received remuneration for participation and provided written informed consent before being included in the study. The study complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority board (permit 2014/1604‐31/1). 

Note that this study is part of a larger project (see study plan  ) including additional imaging methods and paradigms investigating pain processing in FM (Albrecht et al.,  ). One goal of the overall project was to investigate conditioned pain responses in FM subjects (Sandström et al.,  ), which have previously displayed deficits in conditioning and contingency learning (Jenewein et al.,  ; Meulders et al.,  ). Given the need to ensure successful pain conditioning in a sufficient number of participants, a larger number of FM subjects than HC was included in the project, resulting in different group sizes also in the current study. 


### Procedure 
  
Data were collected for each participant over two consecutive days: on the first day all participants received information about the study procedure and provided saliva samples for genotyping. All participants filled out questionnaires regarding pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PCS) (Sullivan et al.,  ), depression (Beck's Depression Inventory, BDI) (Beck et al.,  ), anxiety (State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI) (Spielberger et al.,  ) and health‐related quality of life with a focus on the bodily pain subscale (SF‐36 bodily pain) (Ware & Sherbourne,  ). FM subjects also completed the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) (Burckhardt et al.,  ). 

The PCS measures pain catastrophizing tendencies on a 13‐item scale, with higher scores suggest higher catastrophizing about pain. The BDI is a 21‐item test that assesses depression with higher scores indicating more depressive severity. The STAI‐State subscale consists of 20 items assessing the current state of anxiety with a score ranging from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicative of higher levels of momentary anxiety. The SF‐36 consists of eight scales with bodily pain as a two‐item subscale resulting in a final score ranging from 0 (severe, limiting pain) to 100 (no pain or limitations due to pain). The FIQ is a questionnaire assessing FM‐specific symptoms and disability. It consists of 20 items with a score ranging from 0 to 100, where a higher value indicates a poorer state of health. 

Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were determined in all participants to assess pain sensitivity. The pressure algometer (Somedic Sales AB) was handheld and had a round 1 cm  hard rubber probe that was applied perpendicular to the surface of the tested body part. The manual force was applied at a steady rate (approximately 30 kPa/s) until the participant's pain threshold was reached (Kosek et al.,  ). PPTs were collected bilaterally across four different sites: m. supraspinatus, elbow (lateral epicondyle), m. gluteus, and knee (at the medial fat pad proximal to the joint line) with one assessment per anatomical site. The average PPT across body sites is reported. 

Pressure pain was applied to participants’ left calf using a cuff (13 × 85 cm) attached to a rapid cuff inflation system (E20/AG101; Hokanson). This method of deep tissue pain stimulation was chosen to provide higher ecological validity than, for example, cutaneous noxious stimulation, given that FM is characterized by widespread tissue pain. Applying pressure pain using a cuff inflator was similarly used in FM subjects before, for example, (Loggia et al.,  ). 

In a comprehensive procedure, stimulus pressure intensity was individually calibrated to match ratings of 10 and 50 mm, respectively, on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (strongest imaginable pain), indicated as P10 and P50 throughout this paper. Participants were presented with a series of 5 s stimulations in increasing intensity steps of 25 mmHg in order to determine cuff PPT (first VAS rating >0) and the stimulation maximum (first VAS rating >60). In two following series five stimuli were presented in a randomized manner to determine the individual representation of P10 (starting from the PPT) and P50 (starting from the stimulation maximum). The randomized series to determine P10 used the PPT as a starting point and −2 steps and +2 steps of 25 mmHg. The randomized series to determine P50 used the stimulation maximum as a starting point and −4 steps of 25 mmHg. If the first subjective rating of 10 mm VAS was <100 mmHg, steps of 10 mmHg were used for the randomized series determining P10. Next, subjects were trained in front of a computer monitor to associate green circle with their individually calibrated P10 stimulation and a red circle with their individually calibrated P50 stimulation (familiarization phase), presented in a pseudo‐randomized order (10 × P10; 10 × P50). Following each stimulus, subjects rated their perceived pain on a 100 mm VAS. 

On the second day, participants underwent a pressure pain paradigm during fMRI in which colour cues predicted the following stimulus intensity (Figure  ). As in the training session on the first day, a green circle was followed by the individually calibrated lower intensity pressure stimulus (10/100 VAS, P10) and a red circle was followed by the individually calibrated higher intensity stimulus (50/100 VAS, P50). Both predicting cues, green and red, and subsequent pressure stimulations, P10 and P50, respectively, were each presented 10 times in a pseudo‐randomized manner, resulting in 20 stimuli altogether. Participants were prompted to rate perceived pain intensity on a VAS after each stimulus application. 
  
Schematic representation of the experimental paradigm. In the instructed conditioning paradigm participants were presented with a green or red cue (2 s) that was followed by a delay (2–6 s) before pressure stimulation (5 s) of lower or higher intensity, respectively. Each stimulus presentation was followed by a rating period (8 s) using a 0–100 visual analogue scale (VAS). Intensity of pressure stimulations were individually calibrated to represent approximately 10/100 VAS (P10) and 50/100 VAS (P50). Figure adapted from (Sandström et al.,  ) 
  

### Genotyping 
  
Saliva samples were collected from all participants and used for genotyping, which was performed blind to phenotypic information. In accordance with previous studies, A118G single nucleotide polymorphism   rs1799971   OPRM1 genotypes were split into two groups, AA versus AG/GG (Mura et al.,  ; Tour et al.,  ). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays and ABI 7,900 HT instrument (Applied Biosystems [ABI]). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), with a total volume of 5 ml, were performed in 384‐well plates containing 2.5 ml Universal Master Mix and 5 ng dried‐down genomic DNA per well. The PCR amplification protocol included two holds, 50°C for 2 min and denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 92°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. In one FM and one HC the genotype could not be determined, as the PCRs did not produce secure read‐outs. 


### Statistical analysis of behavioural data 
  
Behavioural data analysis was performed with R (RStudio Team,  ) and included 118 participants (FM patients   n   = 79, HC   n   = 39) (Table  ). A chi‐squared test and fisher's exact test were used to analyse genotype frequencies and to assess deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

To assess differences in calibrated input pressure, a linear mixed effects model (using   nlme  , Pinheiro et al.,  ) with fixed effects pressure level (P10/P50), group (FM/HC) and OPRM1 genotype (AA/*G) including all interactions was used. Variability between participants was accounted for including random intercepts and by‐subject‐over‐pressure level random slopes accounted for individual variability between pressure level. Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate variances of random effects, different variances were allowed for each level of the factors OPRM1 genotype and group, and a first‐order autoregressive correlation structure was modelled to account for intra‐subject dependencies in repeated measures. 

Subjective pain ratings acquired throughout the fMRI paradigm were analysed using another linear mixed effects model. Mixed model analysis was performed with the fixed effects OPRM1 variants, group, pressure level, PPTs and the continuous variable time with random intercepts, accounting for variability between participants, and by‐subject‐over‐time random slopes, accounting for individual variability over time. Interaction effects on pain ratings between OPRM1 genotype and time, group and pressure levels were also tested. As in the mixed model on pressure intensity, restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate variances of random effects, different variances were allowed for each level of the factors OPRM1 genotype and group, and a first‐order autoregressive correlation structure was modelled to account for intra‐subject dependencies in repeated measures. 

In order to investigate the effect of clinical and pain‐relevant variables on pain ratings, another mixed model analysis was performed using only FM subject data. Here, PCS, BDI, FIQ, and SF‐36 bodily pain scores were included to test for a potential association with experimental pain ratings acquired throughout the paradigm. Apart from the additionally included FM‐relevant variables, this model was set up as previously described (without the factor group). 

A two‐way ANOVA with the factors genotype and group was used to test for differences in age. Given the variance differences in groups in clinical measures, that is, PCS, BDI, STAI‐State, SF‐36 bodily pain scores and PPTs, robust two‐way ANOVAs with trimmed means (trim level = 0.2) were performed (using   WRS2  , Mair & Wilcox,  ). STAI data of one FM subject and PPTs of one FM subject were missing at random. Welch tests were performed to test for differences in FM pain duration and FIQ scores between OPRM1 genotypes in FM subjects. A   p   < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses. 


### MRI data acquisition 
  
fMRI data were collected on a 3T Scanner (General Electric 750) using an eight‐channel head coil. Functional images comprised 42 axial slices (slice thickness 3 mm, 0.5 mm gap) and were acquired using a T2*‐sensitive gradient echo‐planar imaging sequence (TR 2 s; TE 30 ms; flip angle 70°; field of view 220 × 220 mm, 72 × 72 mm matrix; 3 × 3 mm in‐plane resolution). The first five volumes were discarded to account for stabilization of the T1‐relaxation effects. Prior to the functional sequence, high‐resolution T1‐weighted anatomical images were acquired (BRAVO, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm, 176 slices). 


### Analysis of fMRI data 
  
Processing and analysis of functional data was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) running under MATLAB (The MathWorks, version R2015b). Data of 105 participants (FM = 70, HC = 35) were included in the fMRI analysis (Table  ). 

First, anatomical and functional scans were reoriented manually to the anterior commissure. Functional images were spatially realigned to the mean volume using a six‐parameter affine transformation. Then, the anatomical T1‐weighted image was co‐registered to the functional images. Functional images were spatially normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic standard space and smoothed with a 6 mm full‐width at half‐maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. Framewise displacement (FD) was used to assess head movement from one frame relative to the previous by calculating the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the six realignment parameters (Power et al.,  ). As a consequence, six participants (four FM subjects, two HC) were excluded from further analyses due to excessive head motion (FD > 0.5 in >15% of the images). There were no differences in FD between FM and HC (Wilcoxon rank sum test,   Z   = 1.58,   p   = 0.1145). The general linear model as implemented in SPM12‐7219 was used for subsequent data analysis. First level analysis included temporal high‐pass filtering (cut‐off 128 s) and correction for auto‐correlations using first‐order autoregressive modelling. The following conditions were modelled on the individual level: pressure stimulations for two intensities (P10/P50, 5 s), two cue‐anticipation phases (red preceding P50/green preceding P10, 2 s cue plus delay of 2–6 s before stimulus onset) and rating period (8 s). Six realignment‐derived motion parameters were added as regressors of no interest. In order to link variations of pain intensity perception to neural activity, additional first level models were specified that included individual pain ratings for each stimulus as a parametric modulator of the regressors representing P50 and P10. Single‐subject contrast images were then taken to second level random‐effects analyses with unequal variances between groups and genotypes being assumed. 

Our functional imaging analysis aimed to test whether the genetic polymorphism of OPRM1 affects pain‐related processing in FM subjects and HC and examine which brain regions may be functionally connected to areas differing between genotypes. In addition, we explored whether OPRM1 influences processing during the cue‐anticipation phase (red preceding P50/green preceding P10), as an indicator for anticipatory and/or psychological processes. First, the effect of painful pressure stimulation and cue‐anticipation was tested separately for each group and pressure level (P10/P50). To test for a possible interaction between OPRM1 genotype and pressure level as well as group and pressure level, two‐sample   t   tests were performed using individual contrast images of (a) pressure intensity (P50‐P10) and (b) cue‐anticipation colour (red preceding P50‐green preceding P10). Groups and genotypes were contrasted separately for each cue‐anticipation colour and during noxious stimulation using parametric trial‐by‐trial responses. An OPRM1 genotype‐by‐group interaction during noxious stimulation as well as during cue‐anticipation was tested using full factorial models. 

A region‐of‐interest (ROI) approach was used to test whether differences between OPRM1 genotypes are present in opioid‐rich brain areas, that is, regions demonstrating a correlation between MOR availability/binding potential and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in FM subjects during evoked pain (Schrepf et al.,  ). ROIs were based on findings by Schrepf and colleagues using anatomical masks derived from the Harvard‐Oxford Atlas freely distributed with FSL ( ). The probability maps, namely left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right precentral gyrus (encompasses the primary motor cortex, M1), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left middle temporal gyrus (temporo‐occipital part) were conservatively thresholded at 50%. Note that the right ACC mask was thresholded at 25%, as a more conservative threshold excluded the subgenual portions, which were reported by Schrepf et al. ( ). Also note that the dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (DLPFC) is not an anatomical region per se but the coordinates reported by Schrepf were best represented by the left middle frontal gyrus (thresholded at 25%). The mask for the cerebellum was also based on the provided coordinates located in crus II based on the SUIT cerebellum atlas ( ). Given that the ROIs were based on data from FM subjects, differences between OPRM1 genotypes were first tested in FM subjects. For completion, and after testing for an interaction effect with group, the analysis was also performed on pooled data. To test for a main effect of OPRM1 within ROIs, two‐sample   t  ‐tests were performed between OPRM1 genotypes for painful pressure stimulations (P10 + P50, that is, pain > baseline). Next, OPRM1 variants were contrasted in a two‐sample   t   test using a whole brain approach to identify regions displaying functional differences outside of opioid‐rich brain areas included in the ROI approach. To further investigate contributions to OPRM1 genotype differences, we explored differences between OPRM1 variants separately in each group. 

A psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) analysis (Friston et al.,  ) was performed to identify differences in functional connectivity associated with the OPRM1 polymorphism pooled across groups. A PPI analysis tests for an interaction between a predetermined seed region in the brain (physiological factor) with other brain areas during an experimental condition (psychological factor). Here, individual time series were extracted from the cluster showing differences in activation between OPRM1 genotypes during evoked pain across group and pressure levels (peak at [−2 –28 48]). We then contrasted the OPRM1 genotypes to identify differences in coupling with other brain regions related to the differential processing of evoked pain between genetic variants. 

Extracted betas from the cluster found to differ between OPRM1 variants in FM subjects were correlated with clinical and pain‐relevant factors for each OPRM1 genotype. Previously, PCC activity has been shown to be increased during FM pain catastrophizing (Lee et al.,  ) and has been associated with trait pain catastrophizing (Galambos et al.,  ). For this reason, betas extracted from the ROI PCC analysis were correlated with PCS scores in FM subjects in an additional analysis. 

For all fMRI analysed the initial statistical threshold was set to   p   < 0.001 and a cluster threshold of   p   < 0.05 (family wise error corrected) was applied, unless otherwise reported. Results are presented stating   x  ,   y  ,   z   coordinates in MNI space. 



## Results 
  
### Behavioural data results 
  
#### Demographics and questionnaires 
  
The participant characteristics are described in Table  . As expected, FM subjects scored significantly higher than HC on PCS (  Q   = 67.743,   p   < 0.001), BDI (  Q   = 180.33,   p   < 0.001), STAI (  Q   = 28.862,   p   < 0.001) and SF‐36 bodily pain (  Q   = 412.284,   p   < 0.001). There was neither a difference between OPRM1 variants nor an interaction between genotype and group with respect to BDI, PCS, STAI, SF‐36 bodily pain and age (all   p   > 0.3). In FM subjects, there was no difference between OPRM1 genotypes in pain duration (  t  (44.7) = −0.193,   p   = 0.848) and FIQ scores (  t  (34.5) = 0.479,   p   = 0.635). 


#### Genotype frequencies 
  
The OPRM1 genotype frequency, that is, the distribution of homozygous AA and G‐allele carriers, in the sample did not deviate from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, (  χ  (1) = 2.17,   p   = 0.141) and was similar in FM subjects and HC (  χ  (1) = 0.546,   p   = 0.46). 


#### Pressure pain thresholds 
  
As expected, FM subjects had significantly lower PPTs than HC (  Q   = 50.86,   p   < 0.001), indicating higher pain sensitivity. No difference between OPRM1 genotypes or interaction between group and genotype was observed in PPTs. 


#### Input pressure 
  
In line with previous findings, FM displayed increased pain sensitivity compared to HC by requiring lower input pressure stimuli for pain intensities equivalent to P10 and P50 (  β   = 56.717 [95% confidence interval (CI) 39.9, 73.4],   t   = 17.38,   SE   = 8.445,   p   < 0.001). In addition, a main effect for the input pressure was found (  β   = 123.731 [CI 109.6, 137.8],   t   = 6.716,   SE   = 7.119,   p   < 0.001). The observed main effects group and input pressure were qualified by statistically significant group × pressure intensity interaction (  β   = 40.331 [CI 17.3, 63.4],   t   = 3.469,   SE   = 11.625,   p   < 0.001). There were no differences between OPRM1 genotypes or interactions including the OPRM1 variant (all   p   > 0.2) (Table  ; Figure  ). 
  
Calibrated pressure input in mmHg for OPRM1 genotypes (*/G vs. AA) to match 10/100 VAS (P10) and 50/100 VAS (P50) pressure intensity. There was a significant difference in input pressure (i) between groups and (ii) between P50 (white boxplot) and P10 (grey boxplot) pressure in mmHg. No difference between OPRM1 genotypes was observed. Whiskers represent the maximum 1.5 interquartile range (IQR). Circles represent data outside the IQR.

#### Pain ratings 
  
There was a difference in pain ratings between stimulus intensities (P10/P50), indicating successful calibration within participants (results are presented in Table  ; Table  ). Pain ratings also differed between groups, indicating FM subjects rated pain intensity higher than HC, despite individual pressure intensity calibration (Figure  ). No difference in ratings over time or between OPRM1 genotypes was observed. No interactions between OPRM1 genotype × stimulus intensity, time or group were found in pain ratings (Figure  ). 
  
Linear mixed model results for predictors of pain ratings 
      
Pain ratings for OPRM1 genotype A (  n   = 88) and OPRM1 G‐carriers (  n   = 30) during 10/100 VAS (P10) and 50/100 VAS (P50) stimulus pressure intensity. Individual pain ratings were acquired using a VAS ranging from ‘no pain’ (0) to ‘worst pain imaginable’ (100). There was a significant difference between groups (FM/HC) and between stimulus intensities (P10/P50) but no difference between OPRM1 genotypes (AA/*G). (a) Pain ratings are displayed for stimuli of lower intensity (P10) and (b) for stimuli of higher intensity (P50). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. FM, fibromyalgia; HC, healthy controls; VAS, visual analogue scale 
  
Given differing group sizes and genotype distributions, Cook's distance was calculated across groups to identify potentially influential data points (118 subjects × 20 ratings, that is, 2,360 observations) in the model. Cook's distance was overall small (mean = 2.03e‐04, median = 6.213e‐05), indicating single data points did not affect the model in a substantial way. Nonetheless, a commonly used cut‐off value of 4/number of observations was adopted to determine potentially influential data points, resulting in 42/2,360 observations (1.78%) surpassing the threshold (1.69e‐03). In order to investigate the influence of these observations, the mixed model was repeated without influential data points, yielding similar results. 

In FM subjects, there was a significant difference in pain ratings between stimulus intensity (P10/P50) but no effect of OPRM1 genotype, time or interaction between them (results are presented in Table  ). Of the included pain‐related measures, only PCS showed a significant effect, with higher PCS scores being linked to higher experimental pain ratings. There was no evidence of PPTs, BDI, FIQ, or SF‐36 bodily pain scores influencing experimental pressure pain ratings in FM subjects.

As in the previous model, Cook's distance in the FM model was overall small (mean = 2.49e‐04, median = 8.01e‐05), with 17 out of 1,580 observations (1.08%) surpassing Cook's distance of 4/number of observations (2.53e‐03). A comparison of mixed models, with and without potentially influential data points, yielded comparable results. 

Analysing only data of participants included in the fMRI analysis (  n   = 105) revealed similar results in all behavioural analyses (see Tables   and  ; Figure  ). 



### Functional imaging results 
  
#### BOLD responses to painful pressure stimulation 
  
Analysis of fMRI data showed increased BOLD response during painful pressure stimulation in brain regions commonly associated with pain processing (Apkarian et al.,  ; Peyron et al.,  ), including insula, postcentral gyrus (primary somatosensory cortex, S1) and parietal operculum (secondary somatosensory cortex, S2) (Figure  ; Table  ). Neural activity linked to pain ratings using parametric modulation displayed increased activation in operculum, ACC, postcentral gyrus, and thalamus (Table  ). BOLD responses during pressure stimulation separately in both FM subjects and HC for each pressure level (P10/P50) are presented in Table  .

   Note    

#### Group differences 
  
Parametric response did not differ between groups, providing no evidence of differing pain processing in individually calibrated pressure intensities. 


#### ROI analyses of OPRM1 differences during painful pressure stimulation 
  
First, we focused on ROIs that had previously shown a correlation between MOR availability/binding potential and BOLD signal during evoked pain in FM subjects, that is, left middle frontal gyrus/DLPFC, left perigenual ACC, left middle temporal gyrus, left PCC, right subgenual ACC and cerebellum (Schrepf et al.,  ). Here, there were significant differences between OPRM1 genotypes in PCC and precentral gyrus (both thresholded at 50%) but not in other predetermined ROIs in FM subjects. Specifically, FM OPRM1 G‐carriers showed increased activation compared to AA homozygotes in PCC and precentral gyrus (Table  ), two opioid‐rich brain regions previously shown to be functionally connected to pain‐evoked BOLD signal in FM subjects.

   Note    
No group‐by‐genotype effect was observed in predetermined ROIs, indicating no systematic difference between groups with respect to OPRM1 genotype. A subsequent ROI analysis on pooled group data revealed very similar results as observed in FM subjects. Specifically, OPRM1 */G displayed increased activation compared to AA homozygotes in PCC and precentral gyrus (Table  ). No effect in the opposite direction, that is, OPRM1 AA> */G, emerged in any ROI analysis. 


#### Whole brain analyses of OPRM1 differences during painful pressure stimulation 
  
For completion, we performed whole brain analyses to test for differences outside of predetermined ROIs, finding no significant interaction between genotype × pressure level (P10/P50), suggesting no substantial difference in BOLD response between the two painful pressure intensities depending on the polymorphism variant. In addition, there was no interaction between OPRM1 genotype (AA/ */G) × group (FM/HC), suggesting genotypes did not differ systematically in neural response between groups. This is in line with the findings in the previous ROI analysis, where no group‐by‐genotype interaction was observed. 

Given that no interactions between OPRM1 genotype × group as well as OPRM1 genotype × pressure level were found, we further investigated whether OPRM1 variants exert an effect on the cerebral processing of noxious stimulation (pain > baseline). We found that OPRM1 genotypes differed significantly in BOLD signal during the processing of painful stimuli in just one prominent cluster, which largely overlapped with findings from the ROI analysis. OPRM1 G‐carriers showed increased activation compared to AA homozygotes in a cluster encompassing PCC and precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus (Figure  ). Note that while we preserved laterality in the ROI analysis (Table  ), the whole brain analysis revealed that the OPRM1 effect stretched across both hemispheres (Table  ). There was no effect in the opposite direction, that is, no increased activation in OPRM1 genotype AA compared to */G.

Carriers of at least one G allele displayed increased activation in a cluster encompassing the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precentral gyrus (peak at [−2 –28 48], Table  ) with an enlarged image of the finding from the region‐of‐interest PCC analysis (peak at [−2 –28 46], Table  ). Results are overlaid on a group‐average structural image (visualization threshold   p   < 0.001 uncorrected).

   Note    
To further identify contributions to the observed OPRM1 genotype differences across groups, we explored differences between OPRM1 variants in FM subjects and HC separately across the whole brain. In FM subjects (  n   = 71), we observed that G‐allele carriers displayed increased activation compared to the AA homozygotes in PCC/precentral gyrus (Figure  ; Table  ). As in the ROI approach, the observed differences between OPRM1 genotypes in FM subjects were found only in a very similar location as observed in the previous analysis including all participants. Comparing OPRM1 genotypes in HC only (  n   = 34), we did not observe differences during evoked pain at the applied threshold. No effect was found in either group for the opposite direction (OPRM1 AA > */G).

Results are overlaid on a group‐average structural image (visualization threshold   p   < 0.001 uncorrected). The bar plot shows group means and standard errors of parameter estimates extracted from the activation cluster of the contrast OPRM1 */G > OPRM1 AA. a.u., arbitrary units; R, right 
  

#### PPI analysis 
  
On the basis of the increased activation in PCC/precentral gyrus in G‐allele carriers observed in the whole brain analysis pooled across groups (peak at [−2 –28 48]), we explored whether different functional connectivity accompanies differences in BOLD activation between genotypes. Here, we observed decreased coupling in OPRM1 genotype */G compared to AA between the described seed cluster comprised of PCC/precentral gyrus with left middle frontal gyrus/DLPFC extending to left precentral gyrus (Figure  ; Table  ). The observed target cluster encompassing the left precentral gyrus was located more lateral than the seed cluster of PCC/precentral gyrus. In addition, decreased functional connectivity in OPRM1 */G was observed from the same seed region with the left angular gyrus extending to the left supramarginal gyrus, that is, areas comprising the inferior parietal lobe (Figure  ; Table  ). There was no effect in the opposite direction, that is, no increased connectivity between PCC/precentral gyrus and other brain regions in OPRM1 */G compared to homozygous AA. 
  
Psychophysiological interaction analysis. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed increased functional coupling in homozygote OPRM1 AA compared to OPRM1 G‐carriers between posterior cingulate cortex/precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus/DLPFC (peak at [−34 2 60], Table  ) extending to the precentral gyrus. In addition, increased coupling was observed with the inferior parietal lobe (peak at [−58 –54 30]), that is, angular gyrus extending to the supramarginal gyrus. Results are overlaid on a group‐average structural image (visualization threshold   p   < 0.001 uncorrected). The bar plots display group means and standard errors of parameter estimates extracted from the respective activation cluster. a.u., arbitrary units; R, right

   Note    

#### OPRM1 differences during the cue‐anticipation phase 
  
There were neither differences observed between groups in the cue‐anticipation phase nor an interaction between groups and cue‐anticipation colour (red preceding P50/green preceding P10). BOLD responses during cue‐anticipation phase for each group and cue‐anticipation colour are presented in Table  . In addition, there was no significant difference between OPRM1 genotypes during the cue‐anticipation phase or between cue‐anticipation colour depending on OPRM1 variant. These results provide no evidence that anticipatory and/or psychological effects processes are affected by OPRM1. 


#### Correlation between BOLD response and clinical measures in FM subjects 
  
Finally, extracted BOLD response in FM subjects from the observed OPRM1 effect (pain > baseline) in the cluster encompassing PCC/precentral gyrus were correlated with clinical and pain‐relevant measures for each OPRM1 genotype. No correlation for either OPRM1 genotype was observed for PPTs, SF‐36 bodily pain or FIQ (all   p   > 0.3), finding no association between BOLD response to evoked pressure pain or any clinical measures in FM subjects depending on OPRM1 genotype. 

In addition, there was no correlation observed between PCC activation obtained from the ROI analysis and PCS scores. Note that using data from the same project we recently found that higher catastrophizing in FM is associated with increased BOLD response in prefrontal cortices and reduced functional connectivity between inferior parietal lobe and thalamus during pressure pain stimulation in a previously conditioned low‐pain condition (Sandström et al.,  ). Importantly, the previously reported correlation between the BOLD response and catastrophizing was located in other brain regions than the OPRM1 effect observed in the current data. 




## DISCUSSION 
  
In this study, we investigated the influence of the functional polymorphism of the MOR gene (OPRM1, A118G   rs1799971  ) on processing of evoked pain in FM subjects and HC using fMRI. Our data showed no systematic difference in neural response to nociceptive pressure stimulation between groups with respect to OPRM1 genotypes. Pooled across groups, we found that OPRM1 G‐carriers (AG or GG) displayed increased activation in PCC extending to the precentral gyrus, compared to AA homozygotes. This finding was observed in FM subjects alone but not in HC, indicating that FM subjects may drive the effect, even though the group‐by‐genotype interaction yielded no significant result. Across groups, decreased functional connectivity was found in OPRM1 */G compared to AA between PCC/precentral gyrus and (a) the fronto‐parietal network, that is, DLPFC/middle frontal gyrus, and (b) inferior parietal lobe, that is, angular and supramarginal gyrus. Our findings suggest that differences in pain‐evoked neural response and functional coupling may mirror differing modulatory mechanisms between OPRM1 variants. 

In accordance with previous studies (Peciña et al.,  ; Tour et al.,  ), OPRM1 genotypes did not differ in pain sensitivity, suggesting that both variants similarly modulate pain but through varying routes. Schrepf and colleagues link the less reactive endogenous opioid system in FM, displayed as reduced MOR availability using positron emission tomography (PET) (Harris et al.,  ) and decreased BOLD response during evoked pain in antinociceptive brain regions (Schrepf et al.,  ). Similar to FM subjects (Baraniuk et al.,  ), OPRM1 G‐carriers could hypothetically have a higher baseline opioid tone and, thus, possess a hyporeactive opioid system when challenged by noxious stimulation, consistent with reduced placebo responses (Peciña et al.,  ). The observed differences between genotypes were located in the PCC, a key node in the default mode network (DMN) (Fransson & Marrelec,  ), suggested to be relevant for internally directed cognition and attention (Leech & Sharp,  ). While differences in PCC were regarded as particularly interesting, the precentral gyrus may contribute to the observed effect, for example, through the discussed role of M1 in experimental muscle pain (Burns et al.,  ). Given our results in two out of several ROIs, our findings suggest that functional consequences of OPRM1 may not be specific to opioid‐rich regions per se, which is corroborated by the expression of MOR throughout the brain (Mansour et al.,  ). G‐carriers displayed reduced functional connectivity between PCC/precentral gyrus and DLPFC (Figure  ), crucially involved in the fronto‐parietal network (Zanto & Gazzaley,  ) and pain modulation (Seminowicz & Moayedi,  ), with DLPFC previously showing reduced MOR binding potential in G‐carriers (Peciña et al.,  ). Our findings indicate alternative modulatory patterns with engagement of the fronto‐partietal network in OPRM1 AA and PCC/precentral gyrus in OPRM1 */G. Interestingly, ROIs (Schrepf et al.,  ) overlapped not only where our data displayed OPRM1 differences in neural processing (PCC/precentral gyrus) but also in functional connections (DLPFC). 

An increased endogenous opioid tone in FM, suggested by elevated endogenous opioids in the CSF (Baraniuk et al.,  ), may lead to opioid‐induced hyperalgesia, shown to be associated with glial activation (Roeckel et al.,  ). Microglia activation was recently demonstrated in precuneus/PCC, S1/M1 and DLPFC, providing evidence for glial involvement in FM pathophysiology (Albrecht et al.,  ). Several of those regions were involved in differing functional patterns between OPRM1 genotypes in the current data. Some drugs presumably acting on glial cells have shown favourable effects in FM, for example, milnacipran (Clauw et al.,  ). Besides its primary mechanism, milnacipran has been shown to mitigate microglia activation in a mouse model (Shadfar et al.,  ), suggesting an effect through microglia modulation. A study in FM subjects showed that the degree of antinociceptive effect of milnacipran correlated with pain‐related BOLD signal in PCC (Jensen et al.,  ). Notably, the PCC peak coordinate in this study [−2 –28 46] was very similar to the location of the positive milnacipran response [−4 –30 46], stressing the clinical role of PCC in FM‐relevant pain modulation. As the OPRM1 effect was significant in FM subjects but not in HC, we speculate that FM subjects drive this finding. 

However, we cannot exclude that OPRM1 */G may confer diminished endogenous opioid tone, due to reduced expression of MOR (Bond et al.,  ). In this sense, the diminished MOR binding potential in OPRM1 G‐carriers (Peciña et al.,  ) is inconclusive, as it could result from increased binding of endogenous ligands, therefore, preventing PET ligand binding and/or reduced MOR expression (Loggia,  ). Arguably, the effect of OPRM1 may be due to reduced MOR availability in FM (Harris et al.,  ) caused by lower expression of opioid receptors in response to long‐term exposure to high levels of endogenous opioids. The latter would be in accordance with reports of OPRM1 */G preventing upregulation of MOR by decreasing OPRM1 mRNA expression following chronic opioid exposure in opioid addicts (Oertel et al.,  ). The effect of OPRM1 */G would then be more pronounced in FM subjects than HC, which is suggested in our data. 

Decreased resting state connectivity in FM has been found between pain‐relevant and sensorimotor areas (Flodin et al.,  ). FM subjects also showed decreased coupling between supramarginal gyrus and S1/M1, brain regions partly displaying reduced connectivity with PCC in G‐allele carriers (Figure  ). In HC, prefrontal cortex and PCC/precuneus increased coupling during painful disruptions, suggesting alternative connectivity patterns between DMN and pain‐relevant regions during evoked pain (Mantini et al.,  ). We found that OPRM1 G‐carriers showed decreased connectivity between PCC/precentral gyrus and inferior parietal lobe, considered a hub for integrating multisensory information (Seghier,  ) and DMN (Davey et al.,  ). Here, increased PCC activation in G‐carriers may indicate failed appropriate deactivation during painful stimulation, where attentional focus is presumably external. Increased connectivity in AA homozygotes may indicate deactivation of the DMN and presumably activation of the fronto‐parietal network (Leech & Sharp,  ). One could argue that reduced control over pain‐relevant pathways in FM during rest may be complemented by additional modulations in connectivity through genetic dispositions independent of disease. 

Functional data did not reveal a significant group‐by‐genotype interaction, indicating similar effects of OPRM1 in FM subjects and HC. As no correlation between PCC/precentral gyrus activation and clinical measures was found, no FM‐specific effects of OPRM1 were identified. With respect to perception, higher catastrophizing scores were linked to higher experimental pain ratings in FM subjects, regardless of genotype. Additionally, no differences in pain‐evoked brain activation between FM and HC were found with perceived pain intensity adjusted between groups, which is in line with previous reports (López‐Solà et al.,  ). However, the interaction analysis may have been insufficiently powered and differential OPRM1 effects between groups cannot be ruled out, in fact, we suggest that the OPRM1 effects were driven by the FM group. Further research is needed to investigate whether cerebral OPRM1 differences are specific to FM. 

Importantly, a combination of the OPRM1 G‐allele and other factors may, nonetheless, play a role in chronic pain. G‐carriers in clinical pain cohorts have been associated with less preferential characteristics (Menon et al.,  ; Tan et al.,  ; Wei et al.,  ). However, contrasting results (Ballina et al.,  ; Linnstaedt et al.,  ) emphasize the need for more research on the role of OPRM1 in acute and chronic pain. 

We did not observe OPRM1 differences in pain sensitivity or pain ratings, which is in line with studies in FM and HC (Peciña et al.,  ; Solak et al.,  ; Tour et al.,  ), however, there have been mixed reports in clinical cohorts (Menon et al.,  ) and HC (Fillingim et al.,  ). Similar to our results, no differences in other FM characteristics, for example, depression, have been observed (Solak et al.,  ; Tour et al.,  ). Given the lacking OPRM1 effect on behavioural/physiological measures, we cannot conclude that the differences in neural processing are accompanied by perceptual or clinically relevant discrepancies. We, thus, suggest that differing cerebral modulatory processes may lead to similar behavioural/perceptual outcome. 

We acknowledge some caveats associated with this study. First, due to the genotype frequency in OPRM1 the absolute number of G‐allele carriers was smaller than homozygous AA, resulting in uneven subgroup sizes. Thus, some analyses may have been insufficiently powered, which limits the interpretability, particularly absent interaction effects between genotype, group and pressure level. We cannot conclude that the OPRM1 effect is specific to a certain pain intensity. Importantly, we emphasize that the observed OPRM1 differences are in need of replication in a larger sample. Second, due to lacking an affective pain measure, the current data cannot corroborate a reported association between the OPRM1 G‐allele and affective regulation (Finan et al.,  ). Finally, as FM is predominant in women, we included only female participants. Our results may, therefore, not be applicable to males. 

To conclude, this study provides further evidence for a functional role of the OPRM1 polymorphism in the neural processing of evoked pain. Specifically, G‐allele carriers showed increased activation in PCC/precentral gyrus and decreased functional connectivity with the fronto‐parietal network, suggesting alternative pain modulatory mechanisms between OPRM1 variants. Finally, we speculate that the OPRM1 effect may be driven by FM subjects.

Developmental models of psychopathology posit that exposure to social stressors may confer risk for depression in adolescent girls by disrupting neural reward circuitry. The current study tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between early adolescent social stressors and later neural reward processing and depressive symptoms. Participants were 120 girls from an ongoing longitudinal study of precursors to depression across adolescent development. Low parental warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms were assessed when the girls were 11 and 12 years old, and participants completed a monetary reward guessing fMRI task and assessment of depressive symptoms at age 16. Results indicate that low parental warmth was associated with increased response to potential rewards in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum, and amygdala, whereas peer victimization was associated with decreased response to potential rewards in the mPFC. Furthermore, concurrent depressive symptoms were associated with increased reward anticipation response in mPFC and striatal regions that were also associated with early adolescent psychosocial stressors, with mPFC and striatal response mediating the association between social stressors and depressive symptoms. These findings are consistent with developmental models that emphasize the adverse impact of early psychosocial stressors on neural reward processing and risk for depression in adolescence.

## Introduction 
  
Depression is a leading cause of global disease burden with a 16.6% lifetime prevalence ( ,  ). Although the prevalence of depression during childhood is less than 3% ( ), rates of depression increase sharply during adolescence with the first onset occurring between the ages of 12 and 19 years in 20% of individuals who experience depression during their lifetimes ( ). Rates of depression are particularly high in adolescent girls (cumulative prevalence of 20.8%), who are twice as likely to become depressed compared to adolescent boys ( ). Because depression is a recurrent disorder, experiencing depression for the first time in childhood or adolescence, compared with onset later in life, results in greater lifetime depression-related disability ( ). Thus, studies that examine risk factors for the development of depression in adolescent girls are particularly relevant for prevention and intervention efforts. 

Parent and peer relationships are both important to adolescent development, and stressors in either social domain can increase risk for psychopathology. There is a large body of research documenting the impact that parenting behaviors, such as emotional responsiveness and warmth, have on children's emotional development broadly ( ,  ), and on depressive symptoms specifically ( ). Additional data from longitudinal studies indicate that low parental warmth increases risk for depression in children and adolescents ( ,  ,  ) and decreases resilience in adolescents with a high genetic and socioeconomic risk for the disorder ( ,  ). Early adolescence in particular is characterized by decreases in parent–child relationship quality ( ,  ), which could contribute to the higher risk for psychopathology during this developmental period relative to childhood. 

Although parents continue to be important sources of social support and play a role in adolescents’ mental health, peer relationships become increasingly important as adolescents individuate from parents and form social hierarchies with peers. Stressful interactions with peers, including emotional exclusion and aggression, are particularly difficult experiences for adolescents ( ,  ), and approximately 50% of sixth and seventh graders experience these forms of peer victimization ( ). Peer victimization is also associated with increased risk for depression. A meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies indicated that peer victimization during childhood or adolescence was moderately associated with depression, and had a stronger relationship with depression than other negative psychosocial outcomes such as anxiety ( ). Peer victimization also predicted later depressive symptoms in several longitudinal studies of children and adolescents ( ,  ,  ). 

Although there is substantial evidence that low parental warmth and peer victimization are both associated with risk for depression, few studies have examined the potential neural mechanisms of these effects. Several developmental models of depression have focused on the interface between adolescent social development and brain development in conceptualizing vulnerability to depression ( ,  ,  ). In this view, adolescent development of neural reward circuitry is a key process in the etiology of depression and depressive anhedonia. Furthermore, stressors that occur during adolescence may disrupt the development of reward-related circuitry, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) – a region implicated in self-relevant and social processing as well as reward function ( ,  ) – and the ventral striatum – a region implicated in motivation to obtain rewards ( ). Consistent with these neurodevelopmental models of depression, neural response during reward anticipation and following rewarding outcomes is disrupted in adolescents and adults with depression ( ,  ,  ,  ). There is also evidence that exposure to early life stress, such as childhood maltreatment, is associated with reductions in reward-directed behavior ( ), and maternal deprivation produces anhedonic behaviors (e.g., decreased sucrose preference) in rodents and non-human primates ( ), behaviors that are supported by neural reward circuitry ( ). 

The aim of the present paper was to examine the relationship between social stressors experienced in early adolescence and neural response to rewards and depressive symptoms in later adolescence. Low parental warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms were assessed at ages 11 and 12 and used to predict neural response during reward anticipation at age 16 in a large sub-sample of adolescent girls from the ongoing Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS). Depressive symptoms were also assessed at age 16 and used to test associations with neural response to potential rewards in areas that were also associated with early adolescent social stressors. Based on previous studies showing increased mPFC response during reward anticipation in depressed adolescents ( ) and adults ( ), we expected that low parental warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms would be associated with increased mPFC response during reward anticipation. We also expected that low parental warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms would be associated with decreased ventral striatum response to potential rewards, consistent with other studies that found decreased striatal response to rewards in clinically depressed samples ( ,  ,  ). Finally, we hypothesized that neural response to potential rewards in the mPFC and ventral striatum would mediate the association between early adolescent social stress and depressive symptoms at age 16, even after controlling for early adolescent depressive symptoms. 


## Materials and methods 
  
### Participants 
  
Participants were girls and their birth mothers recruited from the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study ( ). The PGS sample was formed following an enumeration of households with girls between the ages of 5 and 8 in the city of Pittsburgh. Of the 2992 eligible families, 2451 (85%) were successfully re-contacted and agreed to participate in a prospective study. Girls in the current fMRI study were participants in the ongoing longitudinal PGS Emotions sub-study (PGS-E), a study of precursors to depression beginning with laboratory assessments of girls and their mothers at age 9 years. PGS-E participants were drawn from the youngest participants in the PGS who either screened high on measures of depressive symptoms at age 8, or who were included in a random selection from the remaining 8-year old PGS girls. Girls whose scores fell at or above the 75th percentile by their own report on the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire ( ) and/or by their mother's report on the Child Symptom Inventory ( ) comprised the screen-high group (  N   = 135). There were significantly more African American than European American girls in the screen-high group. Thus, the girls selected from the remainder were matched to the screen-high group on race. Of the 263 families eligible to participate in the PGS-E, 232 (88.2%) agreed to participate and completed the first laboratory assessment when the girls were nine years of age. Retention in each year was above 95%. 

At age 16, 194 participants completed the annual PGS-E assessment and 147 completed the reward task and fMRI scan (22 refused to be scanned or could not be scheduled, 25 were ineligible for scanning at the time of the study due to pregnancy, braces, or other scanning exclusions). An additional 27 participants who completed the scan were excluded from analyses. Reasons for exclusion included <80% striatum coverage (  n   = 12), >2 mm or 2° average movement in any direction during the scan (  n   = 6), poor quality scan (  n   = 2), incidental findings (  n   = 1), <80% response rate on the reward task (  n   = 2), and not understanding the reward task (  n   = 4). Subsequently, data from 120 participants were available for analyses. Of this sample, 65% were Black, 27% were White, and 8% were multi-racial. Sixty percent of the study families received some form of public assistance when the girls were between the ages of 9 and 12, with 26% of the families receiving public assistance continuously during that period. The mean number of years that participants’ families received public assistance was 0.43 (  SD   = 0.42), indicating that participants’ families received public assistance slightly less than 2 out of 4 years (ages 9–12) on average. The study distribution for race and public assistance was representative of the full PGS-E sample. 


### Questionnaires and interviews 
  
Low parental warmth was assessed by parent report using six items from the Parent–Child Rating Scale ( ). Items (e.g., “How often have you wished [your daughter] would just leave you alone”) were scored on a three-point scale (1 = ‘almost never’ to 3 = ‘often’). Higher scores were indicative of lower parental warmth. Cronbach's α for low parental warmth items ranged from 0.75 (age 11) to 0.76 (age 12). Scores at ages 11 and 12 were correlated with one another (Pearson's   r   = 0.59,   p   < 0.001) and were averaged for analysis (  M   = 8.71,   SD   = 2.09). 

Peer victimization was assessed using nine items from the Peer Experiences Scale ( ). Items assessed victimization by physical aggression and social exclusion on a five-point scale (0 = ‘never’ to 4 = ‘a few times per week’). Cronbach's   α   for the nine victimization items ranged from 0.85 (age 11) to 0.83 (age 12). Scores at ages 11 and 12 were correlated with one another (Pearson's   r   = 0.63,   p   < 0.001) and were averaged for analysis (  M   = 3.33,   SD   = 4.30). 

Current symptoms of depression (i.e., past month) were measured in each year using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version ( ), a semi-structured psychiatric diagnostic interview, which was administered separately to the mother and the girl by research assistants who were trained and monitored by a licensed clinical psychologist (KK). Each of the nine symptoms of depression was assessed on a three-point scale (1 = ‘not present’, 2 = ‘subthreshold’, 3 = ‘threshold’) regardless of whether disturbance in mood or anhedonia were endorsed, thereby providing a continuous measure of depression symptom counts. Thirteen percent of the girls’ interviews were randomly selected and coded for assessing interrater reliability. For youth-report data, the average intraclass correlation coefficient for total number of symptoms was 0.92. For caregiver report, the intraclass correlation coefficient for total number of symptoms was 0.58. A symptom was considered present if it was endorsed by either informant. At each wave of data collection the alpha coefficient for the nine depression symptoms based on the combined informants was above 0.55. 


### Reward task 
  
Participants performed a reward-guessing task with a slow event-related design during fMRI acquisition. This task was designed to index brain activation during anticipation of monetary incentives. Previous studies show that this task reliably elicits activation in neural reward circuitry ( ,  ). 

Participants were instructed to guess whether the value of a visually presented card, with possible value from 1 to 9, would be greater than or less than five. Each trial began with the presentation of a blank card. Participants had 4 s to guess the value of the card via button press. The type of trial was then displayed for 6 s using an image with hands shuffling cards overlaid on an upward facing yellow arrow to indicate potential reward trials or a downward facing yellow arrow to indicate potential loss trials. This was followed by presentation of the “actual” value of the card for 500 ms, feedback on the trial outcome for 500 ms (a green upward-facing arrow for win, a red downward-facing arrow for loss, or a yellow circle for a no-change outcome), and a crosshair was displayed for 9 s. There were 24 trials, 20 s each, administered over a single 8 min run. Trials were presented in pseudorandom order and outcomes were predetermined with a balanced number of trial types (12 possible-win, 12 possible-loss; 6 win, 6 loss, and 12 neutral outcomes). This number of trials was previously shown to be adequate to elicit a robust BOLD response in our regions of interest ( ). Participants were told that they would receive their winnings after the scan; in fact, all participants received $10. 


### MRI acquisition, processing, and analysis 
  
Neuroimaging was conducted on a Siemens 3.0 T Tim Trio scanner. BOLD functional images were acquired using a gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence that included 39 axial slices (3.1 mm wide) beginning at the cerebral vertex and extending across the entire cerebrum and most of the cerebellum (TR/TE = 2000/28 ms, field of view = 20 cm, matrix = 64 × 64). Scanning parameters were selected to optimize BOLD signal quality while maximizing whole brain coverage. A reference EPI scan was acquired before fMRI data collection to visually inspect for artifacts (e.g., ghosting) and ensure adequate signal across the entire volume. In addition, a 160-slice high-resolution sagittally acquired T1-weighted anatomical image was collected for co-registration and normalization of functional images (TR/TE = 2300/2.98 ms, field of view = 20 cm, matrix = 256 × 240). 

Preprocessing and analysis of imaging data were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8;  ). Anatomical images were auto-segmented in SPM8 prior to analysis. Functional image preprocessing included spatial realignment to the first volume in the time series to correct for head motion, spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotaxic space using a 12-parameter affine model, and image smoothing using a Gaussian filter set at 6 mm full-width half-maximum to minimize noise and individual differences in gyral anatomy. Voxel-wise signal was ratio-normalized to the whole-brain global mean. Preprocessed data were inspected prior to second-level analysis to ensure that all participants had good whole brain coverage, ventral striatum coverage of at least 80%, and less than 2 mm or 2° average movement in any direction during the scan. 

Second-level random effects models were used to estimate neural response to rewards while accounting for scan-to-scan and between-participant variability. For each participant, condition effects were calculated at each voxel using paired   t  -tests for reward anticipation > baseline. Reward anticipation was defined as the 12 potential-win intervals that included the 6 s potential-win arrow, 500 ms number presentation, 500 ms arrow feedback and the first second of fixation (8 s total). The reward anticipation period extended 2 s beyond the potential-win arrow to account for the delay in hemodynamic response relative to neural activity and capture as much of the reward anticipation response as possible while avoiding substantial overlap with BOLD response to reward outcome events. The last 3 s of fixation for all 24 trials served as the baseline condition. By averaging the last 3 s of fixation across all trial outcomes (6 reward, 6 loss, 12 neutral), the baseline condition served as a relatively neutral comparison for contrasts with reward anticipation ( ,  ). 

Analysis of imaging data focused on four regions of interest (ROIs): striatum, mPFC, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala. ROIs were defined using PickAtlas 3.0.3 ( ). The striatal ROI was defined as a sphere with a 20 mm radius, centered on the Talairach coordinates of   x   = 0,   y   = 10 and   z   = −10, and encompassing the ventral striatum (including nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum bilaterally. The mPFC ROI was defined as a sphere with a 25 mm radius, centered on Talairach coordinates   x   = 0,   y   = 42,   z   = 18, and encompassing BA32 and medial regions of BA9 and BA10. Spheres were used for the striatal and mPFC ROIs because this approach focuses analyses on the striatum and medial regions of BAs 9 and 10 more precisely than atlas-based anatomical masks of those regions (especially for mPFC, which includes medial sections of large prefrontal regions such as BA10). The OFC was defined as BA11 and BA47, and the amygdala was defined using the human PickAtlas label. AlphaSim ( ) cluster extent thresholds were calculated   a priori   to determine the minimum cluster size necessary to maintain a corrected   p   < 0.05 for each ROI (cluster extent thresholds: striatum = 189 voxels, mPFC = 178 voxels, OFC = 62 voxels, amygdala = 62 voxels). 

Regression analyses were performed in SPM8 to determine whether low parental warmth and peer victimization were associated with reward anticipation across participants. Using results of these analyses, a second set of regression analyses were conducted to determine whether current depressive symptoms were associated with neural response during reward anticipation in regions that were also associated with low parental warmth or peer victimization. To accomplish this, functional masks were created based on significant clusters yielded by regressions of BOLD response on early adolescent social stressors for each of the four anatomical ROIs. These functional masks were saved and used as functional ROIs for regressions of depressive symptoms on BOLD response. Because scores for low parental warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms were positively skewed, these scores were log-transformed prior to analysis to better approximate a normal distribution. A constant was added to the peer victimization and depression scores prior to log-transformation because raw scores included values of zero. To account for the potential relationship between early depressive symptoms and neural response to rewards at age 16, all regression analyses included depressive symptom count averaged across ages 9–12 as a covariate. To address potential contributions of SES to development of reward circuitry, regression analyses also included, as a covariate, the average number of years that participants’ families received public assistance across ages 9–12. Regression weights and confidence intervals for significant clusters of activation were computed in SPSS using extracted SPM beta values for the average BOLD response across each significant cluster. 

Finally, for each region that was significantly associated both with early adolescent social stressors and current depressive symptoms, mediation analyses were used to examine whether neural response during reward anticipation accounted for a significant portion of the association between early adolescent social stress and later depressive symptoms. To accomplish this, a second set of functional masks was created based on significant clusters yielded by regressions of BOLD response on current depressive symptoms for each functional ROI described above. These functional masks were saved and used as functional ROIs for regressions of low maternal warmth on BOLD response and peer victimization on BOLD response. Average BOLD response beta values across each significant cluster were extracted from these regressions, and tested as a mediator of the relationships between low maternal warmth and depressive symptoms, and peer victimization and depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses were implemented using the bootstrap method with the SPSS PROCESS macro ( ). Average depressive symptom count from ages 9 to 12 and average years of family public assistance from ages 9 to 12 were included as covariates in mediation analyses. 



## Results 
  
### Participant characteristics and clinical outcomes 
  
Of the 120 girls with analyzable fMRI data, 3 met criteria for current major depressive disorder and an additional 7 met criteria for minor depressive disorder at age 16. The point prevalence of major depression in the sample (2.5%) is consistent with the point prevalence of depression in epidemiologic studies of adolescents (3.37 [95% CI: 1.35, 5.39];  ). The mean number of depressive symptoms at age 16 was 1.18 (  SD   = 1.35). The mean number of depressive symptoms across ages 9–12 was 2.06 (  SD   = 1.57). One-tailed Pearson's correlations indicated that depressive symptoms at age 16 were positively associated with low parental warmth (  r   = 0.42,   p   < 0.001) and peer victimization (  r   = 0.37,   p   < 0.001) in early adolescence. Low parental warmth and peer victimization were modestly associated with each other (  r   = 0.17,   p   = 0.03). 


### Association between early adolescent social stressors and reward-related BOLD response 
  
Lower levels of parental warmth were associated with increased response in the dorsal and rostral mPFC (  R   = 0.10, beta = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14, 1.02,   p   = 0.01), ventral striatum (  R   = 0.11, beta = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21, 1.11,   p   = 0.004), and amygdala (  R   = 0.11, beta = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.76,   p   = 0.012) during reward anticipation. Higher levels of peer victimization were associated with decreased response in the dorsal and rostral mPFC during reward anticipation (  R   = 0.10, beta = −0.26, 95% CI: −0.27, −0.04,   p   = 0.007). OFC response during reward anticipation was not associated with either low parental warmth or peer victimization. Detailed SPM8 regression results are presented in   and  .

LN = natural log transformation. Peer victimization was negatively associated with BOLD response in the rostral mPFC (D;   R   = 0.10). 
  


### Association between reward-related BOLD response and depressive symptoms 
  
Higher levels of concurrent depressive symptoms were associated with increased response in regions of the rostral mPFC (  R   = 0.07, beta = 0.19, 95% CI: −0.01, 0.33,   p   = 0.06) and ventral striatum (  R   = 0.06, beta = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.32,   p   = 0.04) that were also positively associated with low parental warmth. Detailed SPM8 regression results are presented in   and  . In addition, bootstrap tests of mediation indicated that BOLD response in both the mPFC (ES = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.40,   p   < 0.05) and ventral striatum (ES = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.41,   p   < 0.05) significantly mediated the association between low parental warmth and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with neural response during reward anticipation in regions that were also associated with peer victimization.

## Discussion 
  
The results of the present study indicate that social stressors experienced by girls in early adolescence are associated with neural response to anticipated rewards at age 16. Low parental warmth at ages 11 and 12 had particularly robust associations with neural response to reward at age 16, with large clusters of increased activation in the mPFC and ventral striatum during reward anticipation. In contrast, the relationship between peer victimization at ages 11 and 12 and neural response to reward was more modest and in the opposite direction. Greater peer victimization was associated with   decreased   mPFC activation during reward anticipation, and it did not predict reward response in other reward-related ROIs. These results suggest that in early adolescence, low parental warmth may have a greater influence than peer victimization on later adolescent neural response to reward, and that different types of social stressors may influence reward circuitry in different ways. Of note, low parental warmth is likely to be more stable across child development than peer victimization ( ,  ). Girls who experience low parental warmth at ages 11 and 12 may have experienced similar parenting behaviors at multiple time points in development, with cumulative influence on their brain development. Peer groups, in contrast, tend to shift frequently during adolescence ( ). Therefore, the experience of social exclusion or aggression may be more normative, inconsistent, and time-limited, with less robust influence than parental warmth on adolescent brain function. 

We also found that regions of the mPFC and striatum that were correlated with early adolescent parental warmth were also positively related to depressive symptoms at age 16. In fact, neural response to potential rewards in the mPFC and striatum mediated the relationship between low parental warmth and depressive symptoms. The associations of early adolescent parental warmth and subsequent depressive symptoms with mPFC reward anticipation response were in the predicted direction: lower warmth predicted greater dorsal and rostral mPFC response, and higher depressive symptoms predicted greater rostral mPFC response. This is consistent with previous studies that found increased mPFC reward anticipation response in depressed participants ( ,  ). The mPFC is instrumental to evaluating the relative value of rewards and coordinating reward-related behavior ( ) as well as self-relevant and social processing ( ,  ). Increased response in this region in individuals who have experienced low parental warmth or have higher depressive symptoms may reflect increased evaluation of personal performance on the task in light of previous experience or the imagined performance of others. Given that the rostral mPFC is also involved in self-related processing and internal monitoring ( ), increased response to reward in the mPFC could also reflect difficulty disengaging from this internal self-focus during the task. 

In the present study, low parental warmth and higher levels of depressive symptoms were each independently associated with   increased   ventral striatal response during reward anticipation. This pattern was in the opposite direction to our prediction given the existing research in which   decreased   striatal response in depressed participants was observed relative to controls ( ,  ,  ). In those previous studies, however, participants were clinically depressed and samples were comprised of both males and females. The present study also measured reward anticipation response and depressive symptoms when the girls were 16, while other studies have assessed reward response in middle-aged adults ( ,  ) or across wider age ranges (8–17 in  ). Neurons in the mPFC and striatum undergo dramatic pruning and reorganization during adolescence ( ,  ,  ). Therefore, sample differences could reflect the developmental phase of our fMRI and depressive symptom assessment. 

Another possible explanation for this inconsistency with the extant literature is that different depression phenotypes will yield different neural signatures. The striatum is involved in coding the incentive salience, or motivational value, of rewards ( ). Although we cannot tease apart depression sub-types in the current study, it may be that for depression characterized by anhedonia and low positive emotion one would expect blunted striatal activity in anticipation of reward. Depression characterized by dysphoria or irritability may be more reactive to reward opportunities. Similarly, predictable and consistent low parental warmth in the parent–child relationship may confer different risks for atypical neural processing of rewards than inconsistent or unpredictable parenting behavior. Differentiating patterns of brain activity among different depression phenotypes and risk contexts is a critical component to the development of brain-based algorithms for optimizing interventions. Our results suggest that there may be different patterns of neural activity within the broad domain of depression and contextual risks. 

This is one of the first studies to use longitudinal data on early adolescent social stressors to predict brain reward processing and depressive symptoms later in adolescence, and it is the first study of social stress and reward processing in an all-female sample. Adverse parent and peer relationships may be especially influential for girls because girls are more likely than boys to value social cooperation, rely on social support to cope with stressors, attribute negative events to themselves, over-empathize with others, and suppress negative emotions to comply with the others’ expectations ( ). For example, girls who have parents who are cold or punishing may blame themselves for their parents’ behavior and go to great lengths to comply with their parents’ wishes at the expense of their own emotional expression and desire for social support. Furthermore, early-adolescent girls report greater declines in the quality of their relationships with their parents ( ) and have higher rates of relational victimization ( ) than boys. The high value that girls place on social cooperation and support, combined with the decrease in the quality of parent–child relationships and high rate of relational victimization during the transition from childhood to adolescence, may partially account for girls’ relatively greater risk for later depression. Other strengths of this study include the large sample size and the inclusion of participants who are at high risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes due to low socioeconomic status. 

Conversely, because this study included an all-female sample, the relationship between low parental warmth, peer victimization, and neural reward processing in boys remains to be determined. Likewise, because many of the girls in the study were from low-income, urban neighborhoods, the results presented here may not generalize to girls from other socioeconomic backgrounds or environments. Although we included years of public assistance as a covariate in our analyses to control for the effect of poverty on reward response, we were not able to include a comprehensive indicator of socioeconomic status, such as income-to-needs, because complete income information was not provided by all participants. While possibly less fine-grained a measure of SES, public assistance represents an objective measure of family financial difficulty and indicates which of our generally low-SES participants were particularly burdened with poverty. Childhood SES has been reported to influence dorsal mPFC response to reward in adults ( ) as well as emotional processing ( ) and PFC function ( ). Financial stress may also weaken parents’ caregiving resources and the ability of children to cope with psychosocial stressors such as low parental warmth and peer victimization ( ). Additional research that examines the synergistic effects of socioeconomic status, parenting behavior, and peer stressors could delineate the neural mechanisms by which different stressors impact brain function during adolescence. 

Additional study limitations include the cross-sectional fMRI assessment, the circumscribed assessment of psychosocial stress through two self-report measures, and the limited number of trials in the Reward Guessing Task. First, although our design is longitudinal and prospective, we did not assess brain functioning earlier in adolescence, and thus cannot infer that early adolescent social stressors caused disruptions in later neural response to reward. Causality has been established in animal studies, which show that early social stress produces anhedonic behavior in rodents and non-human primates ( ), and these behaviors depend on brain reward circuitry ( ). However, a number of other factors could explain the association between early social stressors and brain reward response in the present study. In particular, girls’ depressive symptoms and/or altered reward responsiveness may influence parenting and peer relationships (e.g.,  ). Furthermore, while some parental psychopathology is likely reflected by our measure of low parental warmth, we did not include a separate index of parent/family psychopathology in our analyses, nor did we include other measures of parenting that could moderate the association between warmth and reward and warmth and depression symptoms. In addition, self-reported data have some limitations, and observational measures of adolescents’ relationships with their parents and peers may provide a clearer picture of the relationship between social stress and neural response to reward. Finally, the limited number of trials in the Reward Guessing Task (12 potential win) may have reduced the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses of reward anticipation response. Notably, including too many trials and thereby extending the duration of the task also has disadvantages due to risk of task habituation, fatigue, and movement. We limited the number of trials in the Reward Guessing Task to balance these risks and because we’ve previously found that 12 reward anticipation trials is an adequate number to elicit a robust BOLD response in our regions of interest ( ). 

Despite these limitations, this study is consistent with the idea that early social stress affects the neurodevelopment of reward circuits and thereby increases risk for depressive symptoms. The results of this study, particularly the divergent directions of association between neural response to reward and the two types of psychosocial stressors studied here, indicate that the influence of specific psychosocial stressors may be differentially weighted in the brain. Future studies of psychosocial stress and reward processing during adolescence should carefully consider the relative impact of parent, peer, and other stressors and their developmental timing on systems involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Furthermore, there is some evidence that neural response to monetary and social rewards differs between females and males: monetary and social rewards elicit similar patterns of striatum response in females, while men are more responsive to monetary rewards and less responsive to social rewards than women ( ,  ). Given the pronounced sex differences in the incidence of depression during adolescence and the influence of psychosocial stressors, it will be important for future studies to examine the influence of psychosocial stressors on reward processing in both sexes. Ultimately, these studies may lead to developmentally-appropriate and sex-specific interventions for reward-related brain function and other neural and behavioral precursors of depression in adolescence.
